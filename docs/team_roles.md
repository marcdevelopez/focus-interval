# 👥 Team Roles & Collaborative Workflow

This project — **Focus Interval** — is developed using a modern, AI-augmented engineering workflow, where a human Lead Engineer works in collaboration with multiple specialized AI agents. This document defines the official roles, responsibilities and collaboration model.

## 🟩 1. Lead Flutter Engineer & Product Owner  
### **Marcos García**

**Primary Role:**  
Lead software engineer responsible for the overall architecture, product direction, and implementation of the Focus Interval application (macOS, Windows, Linux).

**Responsibilities:**

- Owns the product vision and functional specifications.
- Designs and approves technical architecture and system structure.
- Implements core features in Flutter and Dart.
- Leads the development roadmap and organizes phases.
- Validates each iteration of the application and ensures adherence to MVP goals.
- Works with AI copilots to accelerate development and maintain high-quality code.
- Defines Git branch strategy, commit conventions and repository structure.
- Ensures UX/UI coherence and technical correctness across all platforms.
- Coordinates multi-agent collaboration (ChatGPT + Codex).

**Professional Impact:**  
This role demonstrates:

- Leadership in cross-platform development.
- Ability to manage a full engineering cycle end-to-end.
- Practical experience collaborating with advanced AI tooling in real product development.

## 🟦 2. Senior Staff AI Engineer (Architect & Technical Lead)  
### **ChatGPT (AI Co-Engineer)**

**Primary Role:**  
Acts as the architectural and senior technical counterpart in the project.  
Provides high-level direction, structure, patterns, best practices and reviews.

**Responsibilities:**

- Designs system architecture (MVVM, Riverpod state management, navigation, data layers).
- Writes production-level code for complex components.
- Performs code reviews and consistency checks.
- Ensures alignment between specs, roadmap and implementation.
- Generates documentation, specifications and design decisions.
- Guides Marcos (Lead Engineer) in step-by-step development.
- Maintains long-term context of the entire project.

**Function Within the Team:**  
Equivalent to a **Senior Staff Engineer or CTO-as-a-Service (AI)** supporting the Lead Engineer.

## 🟧 3. AI Implementation Engineer (Code Execution & File Operations)  
### **Codex (GitHub Workspace / Code Interpreter)**

**Primary Role:**  
Executes code-level operations and performs mechanical tasks inside the repository.

**Responsibilities:**

- Reads and analyzes the real file system.
- Lists project structure and verifies architecture.
- Applies changes directly to source files.
- Performs refactors, renames and file moves.
- Detects unused imports, inconsistencies and syntax issues.
- Runs static analysis when required.

**Function Within the Team:**  
Codex operates as a **Junior Implementation Developer**, executing tasks under the direction of the Lead Engineer and AI Architect.

## 🧩 4. How Collaboration Works (Workflow Overview)

1. **Marcos** defines what needs to be built (features, tasks, specs).  
2. **ChatGPT** designs the architecture and writes/validates the code.  
3. **Codex** applies the code to the real project files.  
4. **Marcos** tests, validates and moves the roadmap to the next phase.

This tri-agent workflow mirrors what leading software teams call:

### **AI-Augmented Engineering**

where a human Lead Engineer coordinates and supervises one or more AI agents to maximize productivity, correctness and speed.

## 🏆 5. Why This Matters for Professional Experience

This collaboration model demonstrates:

- Ability to lead a real cross-platform Flutter project.  
- Experience with AI-assisted software engineering (in high demand today).  
- Usage of modern state management (Riverpod), navigation (GoRouter), MVVM architecture.  
- Linux/macOS/Windows desktop development.  
- Ability to coordinate multi-agent AI workflows and maintain technical direction.

All of these skills are **strongly valued** in modern software engineering positions.
