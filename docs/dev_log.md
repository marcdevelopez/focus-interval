---

# 📅 Development log

# 🔹 Block 1 — Initial setup (21/11/2025)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Initial `/docs` structure created
- Added full `specs.md`
- Added full `roadmap.md`

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- The final clock animation will be **mandatory** in the MVP 1.2
- The background will be **100% black**
- Resizable window with a dynamic minimum size

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Create the Flutter project
- Create the base project structure (`lib/app`, `lib/data`, etc.)

---

# 🔹 Block 2 — Pomodoro state machine (21/11/2025)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Created the full state machine (`pomodoro_machine.dart`)
- Manually tested with a quick check in `main.dart`
- Confirmed: states, transitions, and strict completion follow the specs
- Validated the machine rejects invalid configs (values <= 0)

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Run lightweight tests directly in the console for now
- Logic remains completely independent from UI and Firebase, per architecture

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Initial config with 0 values threw an exception, as expected

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Create the circular clock widget (PHASE 3)
- Prepare the `timer_display.dart` structure
- Define painter + base animations

---

# 🔹 Block 3 — Premium circular clock (TimerDisplay) (21/11/2025)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Implemented the full circular clock (TimerDisplay)
- Continuous 60fps animation with AnimationController
- Clockwise analog-style hand
- Dynamic colors: red, blue, and green/gold on finish
- Responsive design based on window size
- CustomPainter optimized for desktop
- Visual demo working with Start/Pause/Resume/Cancel controls

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Prioritize premium continuous animation per specs (not tick-based)
- Keep TimerDisplay independent from the main UI
- Validate the final clock UI within the MVVM structure

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Create the base navigation and screen structure
- Implement TimerScreen with TimerDisplay + real logic

# 🔹 Block 4 — TimerScreen + Navigation (21/11/2025)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Integrated `TimerScreen` with `TimerDisplay`
- Added a working premium clock with animated hand
- Added a top digital time display without duplicates
- Added dynamic controls bar (Start / Pause / Resume / Cancel)
- Partial Riverpod sync achieved
- Navigation to execution screen via GoRouter
- Final behavior on task completion working with popup

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Pomodoro ViewModel will be managed with Riverpod (PHASE 5)
- Execution logic now depends on `pomodoro_view_model.dart`, not local demos
- Execution screen replaces the provisional demo

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Duplicate time display on screen (fixed)
- Missing import and invalid `style:` param inside `_CenterContent` (fixed)

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Start PHASE 5: full Riverpod MVVM
- Create global state structure for tasks
- Prepare providers for Firebase Auth and Firestore (not connected yet)

# 🔹 Block 5 — Roles documentation (22/11/2025)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Created `docs/team_roles.md` with:
  - Lead Flutter Engineer (Marcos)
  - Staff AI Engineer (ChatGPT)
  - AI Implementation Engineer (Codex)
- Updated README to link it
- Added a professional structure for recruiters

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep this file as the official AI+Human team document
- Use it as a professional reference in interviews

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Finish PHASE 5 (full Riverpod integration)
- Prepare PHASE 6 (Firebase Auth)

# 🔹 Block 6 — Riverpod MVVM (Subphases 5.1 and 5.2) — 22/11/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- Created PomodoroViewModel with an initial `Notifier` implementation
  (migration to `AutoDisposeNotifier` pending for Phase 5.3).
- Connected the main PomodoroMachine stream.
- States synced correctly with the UI via Riverpod.
- First stable integration version without crashes.
- Fixed “Tried to modify a provider while the widget tree was building”
  by moving calls outside lifecycle.

### ❗ Updated actual status:

- **TimerScreen still contains:**
  - local `_clockTimer`
  - temporary `configureTask(...)` in `initState`
- This will be removed in **Phase 5.3** when all logic moves to the ViewModel.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep `Notifier` temporarily to avoid breaking TimerScreen
  before completing the full migration.
- Delay removing local timers until the VM fully manages
  progress, remaining seconds, and phases.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Complete **Phase 5.3**, moving ALL time logic into the ViewModel.
- Migrate PomodoroViewModel to `AutoDisposeNotifier`.
- Remove `_clockTimer` and TimerScreen demo config completely.

---

## 🔹 Block 7 — Real sync of project state (22/11/2025)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Structural fixes in `providers.dart`:
  - Added missing `pomodoro_task.dart` import
  - Fixed type errors in `taskListProvider` and `taskEditorProvider`

- Aligned code state with Riverpod 2.x:
  - `TaskListViewModel` as `AsyncNotifier<List<PomodoroTask>>`
  - `TaskEditorViewModel` as `Notifier<PomodoroTask?>`

- Confirmed the build is stable again after fixes
- Reviewed global providers structure in the MVVM architecture

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep `PomodoroViewModel` as `Notifier` temporarily while subphase 5.3 completes
- Postpone migration to `AutoDisposeNotifier` until TimerScreen is fully unified with the ViewModel
- Prioritize consistency between roadmap and REAL code instead of blindly following prior planning

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Several inconsistencies between code and roadmap caused:
  - Unrecognized generic types
  - Out-of-sync providers
  - Cascading compilation errors

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Complete PHASE 5.3: unify clock + timer + stream in the ViewModel
- Remove TimerScreen demo config completely
- Update PomodoroViewModel → `AutoDisposeNotifier` per roadmap

### 🔄 Important documentation adjustments:

- Discrepancies between roadmap and real code were found.
- dev_log.md was updated to reflect that:
  - PomodoroViewModel is still `Notifier` (not AutoDispose yet).
  - TimerScreen kept temporal logic (local timer + demo config).
- This will be corrected during Phase 5.3.

# 🔹 Block 8 — Phase 5.3 (TimerScreen + ViewModel unification) — 22/11/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- `pomodoroMachineProvider` is now `Provider.autoDispose` with cleanup in `onDispose`.
- `PomodoroViewModel` exposed via `NotifierProvider.autoDispose`, subscribed to `PomodoroMachine.stream` and cleaning subscriptions in `onDispose`.
- `TimerScreen` loads the real task via `loadTask(taskId)` and removes demo config.
- System time restored with `_clockTimer` and `FontFeature` for tabular digits in the appbar.

### 🧠 Decisions:

- Keep `_clockTimer` exclusively for system time; all Pomodoro logic lives in ViewModel/Machine.
- `loadTask` maps `PomodoroTask` → `configureFromTask` to initialize the machine.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Add placeholder providers `firebaseAuthProvider` and `firestoreProvider` (Phase 5.4).
- Connect TimerScreen with real task selection from list/editor and final states (Phase 5.5).

---

# 🔹 Block 9 — Phase 5.4 (Firebase placeholders) — 22/11/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added placeholder providers `firebaseAuthProvider` and `firestoreProvider` in `providers.dart` (null references, no real integration).
- Added `firebase_auth` and `cloud_firestore` dependencies to `pubspec.yaml` (real integration pending in phases 6–7).
- Preserved import compatibility with Riverpod (hiding `Provider` in Firebase imports).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement real Auth/Firestore services in `data/services` (Phases 6–7).
- Connect TaskRepository to Firestore once real services are integrated.

---

# 🔹 Block 10 — Phase 5.5 (TimerScreen refactor + task connection) — 22/11/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- TimerScreen loads the real task by `taskId`, shows a loader until configured, and disables Start if it fails.
- Handles missing task with snackbar + automatic back.
- `ref.listen` integrated in build to detect `PomodoroStatus.finished` and show final popup.
- TimerDisplay forces 100% progress and final color (green/gold) in `finished` state.

### 🧠 Decisions:

- Keep InMemoryTaskRepository as local data source until Firestore arrives (Phases 6–7).
- Final popup closes to the list; final animation will be shown on the circle.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Start Phase 6: configure Firebase Auth (Google Sign-In) and real providers.
- Connect TaskRepository to Firestore once services are ready.

---

# 🔹 Block 11 — Phase 6 (Auth start) — 23/11/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added override to disable `google_sign_in` on macOS (kept on Win/Linux/iOS/Android/Web).
- Created `FirebaseAuthService` skeleton (Google + email/password) and `FirestoreService` with safety stubs.
- Exposed providers for services (`firebaseAuthServiceProvider`, `firestoreServiceProvider`) using a default stub until real credentials are set.
- Updated macOS bundle ID to `com.marcdevelopez.focusinterval` (unified namespace).

### 🧠 Decisions:

- Keep stub to avoid local crashes until Firebase is configured (in this initial block).
- Auth strategy: Google Sign-In for iOS/Android/Web/Win/Linux; email/password for macOS.
- Firebase is not initialized yet; real integration will be done with credentials in phases 6–7.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Configure Firebase Core/Auth with real credentials; use email/password on macOS and Google elsewhere.
- Replace stub providers with real instances once Firebase is configured.
- Adjust bundle IDs on other platforms to the unified namespace when needed.

---

# 🔹 Block 12 — Phase 6 (Auth configured) — 23/11/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- Ran FlutterFire with unified bundles `com.marcdevelopez.focusinterval` (android/ios/macos/windows/web) and generated `firebase_options.dart`.
- Added the correct `GoogleService-Info.plist` to the macOS target (Build Phases → Copy Bundle Resources) and removed duplicates.
- Providers point to real services (`FirebaseAuthService`, `FirebaseFirestoreService`); Firebase initializes in `main.dart`.
- Auth strategy active: Google on iOS/Android/Web/Windows, email/password on macOS.
- Console config enabled: Google + Email/Password.

### 🧠 Decisions:

- Reuse the web config for Linux until a specific app is generated; no UnsupportedError in `DefaultFirebaseOptions`.
- Keep a single namespace `com.marcdevelopez.focusinterval` across all platforms.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Phase 7: integrate real Firestore and connect repositories to remote data.
- Add login UI (email/password on macOS, Google elsewhere) to validate flows.

---

# 🔹 Block 13 — Phase 7 (Firestore integrated) — 24/11/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- Created `FirestoreTaskRepository` implementing `TaskRepository` on `users/{uid}/tasks`.
- `taskRepositoryProvider` switches Firestore/InMemory based on session; list refreshes on user change.
- Login/register refresh tasks and logout invalidates state; tasks isolated by uid.
- UI shows email and logout button; Firestore repo active when a user is authenticated.

### 🧠 Decisions:

- Keep InMemory as fallback without session.
- Firestore rules to isolate data by `uid` (apply in console).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Phase 8: polish CRUD/streams and fully connect UI to Firestore.

---

# 🔹 Block 14 — Phase 8 (Reactive repo auth bugfix) — 28/11/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- `AuthService` exposes `authStateChanges` and `authStateProvider` listens to login/logout.
- `taskRepositoryProvider` rebuilds on user change and uses `FirestoreTaskRepository` when logged in.
- `TaskListViewModel` refreshes the list on `uid` change; tasks now sync across devices with the same email/password.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- The repo was instantiated before login and stayed in local memory; tasks were not saved to Firestore or shared across platforms.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Continue Phase 8: full CRUD and streams over Firestore.
- Re-create test tasks after login to persist them in `users/{uid}/tasks`.

# 🔹 Block 15 — Phase 8 (Reactive CRUD with streams) — 17/12/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- `TaskRepository` now exposes `watchAll()`; InMemory and Firestore emit real-time changes.
- `TaskListViewModel` subscribes to the active repo stream and updates the UI without manual `refresh`.
- Removed forced refreshes from `LoginScreen` and `TaskEditorViewModel`; the list depends only on the stream.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep InMemory as fallback without session, but also stream-based for coherence and local testing.
- Centralize the source of truth in `watchAll()` to reduce point reads and avoid inconsistent states.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate Firestore stream latency and errors; consider optimistic handling for edits/deletes.
- Review editor validations and list loading/error states.

# 🔹 Block 16 — Phase 9 (Reactive list and login UX) — 17/12/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- `InMemoryTaskRepository.watchAll()` now emits immediately on subscription; avoids infinite loaders without a session.
- Adjusted `LoginScreen` with dynamic `SafeArea + SingleChildScrollView + padding` to remove the Android keyboard overflow rectangle.
- Verified on macOS, iOS, Android, and Web: reactive task list; loader disappears without session. Windows pending.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep reactive behavior across all repos (InMemory/Firestore) as the single source of truth.
- Login remains email/password on macOS/Android/web; Google on web/desktop Win/Linux pending test.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Test on Windows (Google Sign-In) and validate CRUD/streams.
- Start Phase 10: review the editor form per roadmap (full fields, sounds) and polish validations.

# 🔹 Block 17 — Phase 10 (Editor validations) — 17/12/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- `TaskEditorViewModel.load` returns `bool` and edit flows show a snackbar/close if the task does not exist.
- Business validation: long break interval cannot exceed total pomodoros; save is blocked and the user is informed.
- UX handling: when editing from the list, if loading fails, it notifies and does not navigate to the editor.
- Added per-event sound selector in the editor (placeholder options, real assets pending) and persisted strings in model/repo.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Prioritize editor validations and UX before adding new fields (e.g., sounds) in this phase.
- Keep the editor reactive to the active repo (Firestore/InMemory) without extra changes.
- Reduce sound configuration to essentials (pomodoro start, break start) and keep the final sound as a default to avoid confusion.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Add sound selection (once assets/definitions are ready) and persist it in the model.
- Windows test pending; if it passes, update roadmap/dev_log with date.

# 🔹 Block 18 — Phase 10 (Editor completed) — 17/12/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- Full editor with minimal configurable sounds (pomodoro start, break start) and a fixed final sound by default.
- Business validations active and error handling when loading/editing missing tasks.
- Roadmap updated: Phase 10 marked as completed; current phase → 11 (event audio).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement audio playback (Phase 11) with default assets.
- Windows test pending and update docs when validated.

# 🔹 Block 19 — Phase 11 (Event audio, setup) — 17/12/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added `just_audio` and `SoundService` with an id→asset map and silent fallback if the file is missing.
- Integrated the service via provider and PomodoroMachine callbacks to trigger sounds on pomodoro start, break start, and task finish.
- Created `assets/sounds/` with README and included it in `pubspec.yaml`; pub get executed.
- Added default audio files: `default_chime.mp3`, `default_chime_break.mp3`, `default_chime_finish.mp3`.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep three sounds in the MVP 1.2: pomodoro start, break start, and task finish (fixed), avoiding duplication with break end.
- If an asset is missing or fails to load, ignore it and log in debug; do not show an error to the user.
- Some selector ids had no mapped asset, causing silence on pomodoro start; resolved by mapping aliases to existing assets.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Test playback on macOS/Android/Web with the added audios. ✔ (completed)
- Update dev_log/roadmap with the date once playback is confirmed on platforms. ✔ (completed)

# 🔹 Block 20 — Phase 11 (Event audio completed) — 17/12/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- Sound playback confirmed at pomodoro start, break start, and task finish (Android/Web/macOS).
- Sound selector aliases mapped to assets to avoid ids without paths.
- Audio code simplified without temporary logs or unused fields.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Test on Windows when possible and note the date if it passes.
- Continue with Phase 12 (Connect Editor → List → Execution).

# 🔹 Block 21 — Phase 12 (Connect Editor → List → Execution) — 17/12/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- TimerScreen loads the real task from the list and uses the ViewModel for all execution.
- Changes in the editor (durations, sounds) are reflected when opening execution; missing task handling shows a snackbar and returns.
- Editor → List → Execution flow working on macOS/Android/Web (Windows pending).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Test the full cycle on Windows when possible and record the date.
- Move to Phase 13 (real-time Pomodoro sync).

# 🔹 Block 22 — Phase 13 (Real-time sync, setup) — 17/12/2025

### ✔ Work completed:

- Created `PomodoroSession` model and Firestore repository (`users/{uid}/activeSession/current`) with publish/watch/clear.
- `PomodoroViewModel` publishes state on key events (pomodoro start, break start, pause, resume, finish/cancel) with `ownerDeviceId`.
- Basic mirror mode: if the session belongs to another device, the VM mirrors the remote state (remaining time derived from `phaseStartedAt` when available).
- Basic deviceId generated per app session; persistence between runs pending.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Test with two real devices (same account) and validate delay <2s; adjust if ticks or timestamps need publishing.
- Decide whether to persist `deviceId` locally to keep ownership across restarts.

---

# 🔹 Block 23 — Phase 13 (Validation + ownership) — 06/01/2026

### ✔ Work completed:

- Real-device sync validated (2 devices, same account) with worst-case latency <1s.
- Confirmed mirror device cannot control owner, per specs.
- Persisted `deviceId` locally (SharedPreferences) to keep ownership after restarts.
- Added "Take over" action to claim ownership when the remote owner is unresponsive.
- Fixed macOS task editor input by using controllers and syncing state on load.
- Re-tested restart/reopen flow: owner can resume/pause/cancel consistently; take over validated when owner is down.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Persist `deviceId` once per install and inject via ProviderScope override.
- Allow take over when a running phase is overdue or a non-running session is stale.
- Take over thresholds: running phase overdue by 10s; paused/idle stale after 5 minutes.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Start Phase 14: integrate notifications for pomodoro end + task finish.

---

# 🔹 Block 24 — Phase 14 (Notifications, setup) — 07/01/2026

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added NotificationService using `flutter_local_notifications`.
- Initialized notifications in `main.dart` and injected via provider.
- Triggered notifications on pomodoro end and task finish.
- Deferred permission prompts to avoid blocking app launch and request on TimerScreen.
- Enabled Android core library desugaring for notifications.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run `flutter pub get` and validate notifications on macOS/Android.
- Confirm Windows/Linux behavior and adjust platform settings if needed.
- Re-test Android build after desugaring change.

---

# 🔹 Block 25 — Phase 14 (Notifications + UX polish) — 07/01/2026

### ✔ Work completed:

- Auto-dismissed the "Task completed" modal when the session moves out of finished state.
- Scoped auto-dismiss to mirror sessions so local completion still requires confirmation.
- Added a macOS notification center delegate to show banners/lists in foreground.
- Reset finished state on owner acknowledgement (OK) and expose "Start again".
- Allow immediate take over when a session is already finished.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate macOS banner delivery in foreground/background.
- Decide whether mirrors should fire notifications for remote-owned sessions.

---

# 🔹 Block 26 — Phase 14 (Background catch-up) — 07/01/2026

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added app resume handling to fast-forward the owner state using timestamps.
- Projected mirror state from `phaseStartedAt` to avoid frozen 00:00 when the owner is backgrounded.
- Allowed the timer to catch up and publish the updated session on resume.
- Validated Android resumes in sync with real time across devices.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement true Android background ticking (foreground service) to avoid relying on resume.
- Confirm macOS banner delivery (foreground/background).

---

# 🔹 Block 27 — Phase 14 (Android foreground service) — 07/01/2026

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a native Android foreground service with wake lock to keep the app process alive.
- Wired a Flutter method channel to start/stop/update the foreground notification.
- Hooked the service lifecycle into the pomodoro state (start on run, stop on pause/cancel/finish).
- Validated Android background timing against iOS/macOS with sub-second drift.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Confirm macOS/iOS banner delivery (foreground/background).

---

# 🔹 Block 28 — Phase 14 (macOS notifications) — 07/01/2026

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a macOS native notification channel to schedule notifications via UserNotifications.
- Requested permissions and delivered banners in foreground and background for owner sessions.
- Validated macOS notifications after task completion on device.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate Windows/Linux notification delivery if required for MVP 1.2.

---

# 🔹 Block 29 — Phase 6 (Android Google Sign-In debug keystore) — 08/01/2026

### ✔ Work completed:

- Identified Google Sign-In failure caused by a new macOS user generating a new debug keystore.
- Updated SHA-1/SHA-256 in Firebase and replaced `android/app/google-services.json`.
- Confirmed Google Sign-In works and session persists after rebuild.

---

# 🔹 Block 30 — Phase 6 (Auth roadmap note: macOS OAuth) — 08/01/2026

### ✔ Work completed:

- Logged a post-MVP note to add macOS Google Sign-In via OAuth web flow (PKCE + browser).

---

# 🔹 Block 31 — Phase 6 (iOS Google Sign-In fix) — 08/01/2026

### ✔ Work completed:

- Fixed iOS Google Sign-In crash by adding the REVERSED_CLIENT_ID URL scheme to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
- Verified Google Sign-In works on iOS and the session persists.

---

# 🔹 Block 32 — Phase 6 (Windows desktop validation and auth stubs) — 08/01/2026

### Work completed:

- Validated Windows desktop build and runtime.
- Added a CMake policy minimum and install prefix override to avoid Firebase C++ SDK build/install failures.
- Guarded Google Sign-In, audio, and notifications on Windows with safe stubs/logs.
- Documented Windows desktop audio/notification follow-up in the roadmap.

### Issues found:

- Firebase C++ SDK emits a CMake minimum version warning on newer CMake.
- Windows build failed installing to Program Files without admin permissions.
- Legacy Firebase accounts created before provider linking return `firebase_auth/unknown-error` on Windows (C++ SDK).

### Decisions made:

- Keep Windows desktop running with email/password only; Google Sign-In stays disabled where unsupported.
- Disable audio and local notifications on Windows until a supported plugin or native implementation is selected.
- Keep generated plugin registrants and build artifacts out of commits when building on Windows.

### Next steps:

- Evaluate Windows-capable audio and notification plugins or native Windows integration.
- Optionally add a migration hint for legacy accounts on Windows.
- Before pushing from Windows, restore generated plugin registrants and remove `android/build` to avoid cross-platform churn.

---

# 🔹 Block 33 — Phase 14 (Windows audio/notifications via adapters) — 08/01/2026

### Work completed:

- Added `audioplayers` and `local_notifier` dependencies for Windows desktop.
- Implemented a Windows audio backend using `audioplayers` while keeping `just_audio` for other platforms.
- Implemented a Windows notification backend using `local_notifier` while keeping `flutter_local_notifications` for other platforms.
- Kept `SoundService` and `NotificationService` as the only public APIs with internal platform adapters.
- Normalized Windows audio asset paths for `audioplayers`.
- Verified Windows audio + notifications and confirmed sync with Android after updating the Android build.
- Spot-checked macOS/Android/iOS/Web for regressions.
- Verified macOS behavior after switching back from Windows.
- Confirmed owner notifications are visible.
- Verified web audio in Chrome (macOS).
- Added Web Google Sign-In client ID meta tag.
- Enabled web notifications via the Notifications API (permission required).
- Enabled Google People API and verified Web Google Sign-In in Chrome.
- Verified web notifications while the app is open (including minimized).
- Confirmed the “Task completed” modal auto-dismisses when another device restarts the same task.

### Issues found:

- Resolved: Windows start/break sounds play correctly while notifications fire (re-tested after path normalization).
- Resolved: Mirror Android device phase mismatch cleared after updating to the latest build.
- Resolved: Web Google Sign-In works after enabling Google People API.
- Resolved: Web notifications enabled (requires browser permission and app open).
- Open: Linux audio/notifications still not verified.

### Decisions made:

- Notifications on Windows are now working correctly, including proper triggering and sound playback
- Keep platform branching inside services and fail silently with debug logs.

### Next steps:

- Verify Linux audio/notifications.

---

# 🔹 Block 34 — Phase 14 (Linux dependency checks and docs) — 13/01/2026

### Work completed:

- Documented Linux desktop dependencies per distro (GTK, libnotify, GStreamer).
- Added a Linux startup dependency check with a warning dialog for missing audio
  or notification libraries.
- Included copy-to-clipboard support for install commands.
- Linked the Linux dependency guide from the README.

### Issues found:

- None.

### Decisions made:

- Keep the Linux dependency check best-effort and non-blocking.

### Next steps:

- Verify the Linux startup dialog with missing dependencies and after installing
  packages.

---

# 🔹 Block 35 — Phase 6 (Linux auth guard on task list/login) — 13/01/2026

### Work completed:

- Hid the login entry point on Linux where Firebase Auth is not supported.
- Added a safe fallback in the login screen to return to the task list when
  authentication is unavailable.

### Issues found:

- None.

### Decisions made:

- Keep authentication flows unchanged on supported platforms.

### Next steps:

- Validate the Linux task list UX now that login is disabled.

---

# 🔹 Block 36 — Phase 14 (Linux dependency debug override) — 13/01/2026

### Work completed:

- Added a debug-only dart-define to force missing Linux dependencies for UI
  testing without changing release behavior.

### Issues found:

- None.

### Decisions made:

- Keep the override inactive by default and only evaluated in debug mode.

### Next steps:

- Validate the dependency dialog using the forced flag.

---

# 🔹 Block 37 — Phase 14 (Linux dependency dialog navigator fix) — 13/01/2026

### Work completed:

- Fixed the Linux dependency dialog to use the app navigator context to avoid
  crashes at startup.

### Issues found:

- Dependency dialog crashed when shown from a context without a Navigator.

### Decisions made:

- Route dialog presentation through the root navigator key.

### Next steps:

- Re-test the forced dependency dialog on Linux.

---

# 🔹 Block 38 — Phase 14 (Remove Linux dependency debug override) — 13/01/2026

### Issues found:

- None.

### Decisions made:

- Keep Linux dependency checks clean and production-only.

### Next steps:

- None.

---

# 🔹 Block 39 — Phase 14 (Linux notifications via local_notifier) — 13/01/2026

### Work completed:

- Switched Linux notifications to use `local_notifier` for better reliability.
- Kept other platforms unchanged.
- Verified Linux notifications when completing a task.

### Issues found:

- Linux notifications were not appearing with the previous backend.

### Decisions made:

- Reuse the desktop notification backend used on Windows for Linux as well.

### Next steps:

- None.

---

# 🔹 Block 40 — Phase 6 (Linux local task persistence) — 13/01/2026

### Work completed:

- Added a local disk-backed task repository for Linux when auth is unavailable.
- Kept task behavior unchanged on platforms with Firebase Auth support.
- Verified task persistence across app restarts on Linux.

### Issues found:

- None.

### Decisions made:

- Use shared_preferences for low-friction local persistence on Linux.

### Next steps:

- None.

---

# 🔹 Block 41 — Phase 6 (Linux sync notice) — 13/01/2026

### Work completed:

- Added a Linux-only sync notice dialog explaining web sync availability.
- Added an info action on the task list for Linux to reopen the notice.
- Verified the sync notice on Android and web (Chrome).

- None.

---

# 🔹 Block 47 — Phase 14 (Local custom sounds + per-device overrides) — 17/01/2026

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added typed `SelectedSound` and local custom sound picker for Pomodoro start and Break start.
- Custom sounds are stored per-device only via SharedPreferences overrides (not synced to Firestore).
- Built-in options aligned to the three available assets to ensure selection always maps to real files.
- Added validation for local imports (format/size/duration) and fallback to built-in on failure.
- Verified local sound selection on macOS/iOS/Android; web picker disabled on Chrome.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Sound selection appeared unchanged because built-in options mapped to the same asset; fixed by aligning selectors to the three available assets.
- Initial analyzer errors after refactor (duplicate `save()`, missing helper methods, and async context checks) were resolved.
- macOS file picker required Xcode sandbox user-selected file access to open the dialog.

- Included final breaks in task/group duration calculations and end-of-task projections.
- Unified TimerScreen/TaskList ranges with the group timeline (placeholders before actual start).
- Stabilized task transitions by publishing completed sessions only at group end.
- Repository normalization now derives theoreticalEndTime from actualStartTime + totalDurationSeconds only.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Task ranges were recalculated from per-task starts and missed final breaks, causing drift and flicker at task boundaries.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Single source of truth for ranges is group.actualStartTime with accumulated durations and pause offsets.
- Pre-start states show placeholders instead of inferred timestamps.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-run multi-task scenarios on device to validate timing consistency end-to-end.

- Scheduling by total range/time: if the planned end is earlier than requested, show a lightweight notice with “Don’t show again”.
- Updated roadmap with new phases and reopened phase list.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Default group names use English date/time format (e.g., "Jan 1 00:00", 24h).
- Duplicate group names auto-append a short date/time suffix.
- Scheduling redistribution reuses task weight algorithm (roundHalfUp, min 1 pomodoro).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement Phase 20 items in code after review.

# 🔹 Block 260 — Mode A global breaks (04/02/2026)

- Added mode-aware group/task duration utilities and updated scheduling/end-time calculations.
- Updated Task List selected preview and TimerScreen planned ranges to respect integrity mode.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

Mode A global long-break sequencing not fully validated (time constraints).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate multi-task runs with shared structure (global long-breaks) across devices.
- Other changes in this block were verified locally.

# 🔹 Block 261 — Run Mode task transition catch-up (05/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added owner-side group timeline projection on resume/hydrate to advance across tasks after background time.
- Reused the group timeline projection helper outside Local Mode when safe.
- Ensured corrected state publishes back to the active session after projection.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Task transitions could stall at `finished` after app suspension, leaving the next task unstarted.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate task-to-task auto-advance after background/resume on Android/iOS/Web.

# 🔹 Block 262 — Completion modal on owner/mirror + fallback nav (05/02/2026)

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate completion modal + Groups Hub navigation on owner and mirror devices.

# 🔹 Block 263 — Mirror completion modal without owner (05/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Showed completion modal on mirror when the last task finishes, even if the owner is offline.
- Guarded against false positives on non-last tasks.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Mirror devices could stay on the green finished timer until the owner reconnected.

### ✔ Work completed:

- Documented activeSession cleanup rules in specs (terminal states + stale sessions).
- Added owner-side activeSession clearing on group completion.
- Added stale activeSession cleanup when groups are not running (global + load guard).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Stale activeSession could block ownership for new executions and persist after completion.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate Run again/Start now ownership transfer across macOS/Android.
- Confirm activeSession clears on completion/cancel and Groups Hub no longer shows a running card.

# 🔹 Block 265 — Stale session completion (06/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Allowed auto-completion when an activeSession is stale and the group has passed theoreticalEndTime.
- Cleared stale activeSession for expired running groups (including remote owner cases).
- Added load-time sanitization for expired + stale sessions.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Permit non-owner cleanup only when the session is stale and the group has clearly expired, to preserve single-writer rules while eliminating zombie runs.
- Treat activeSession as strictly ephemeral; clearing it on expired groups is required to keep Groups Hub consistent across devices.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Documented the ownership-change realignment rule in specs.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None observed during implementation (validation pending).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Reproduce the original multi-owner pause/resume test across Android/Web/iOS.
- Confirm no dual timers or jitter after ownership changes.

- Updated Firebase init to select env-specific options and connect emulators in DEV.
- Added `dataVersion` support to critical models and a dual-read/dual-write migration template.
- Documented DEV/STAGING/PROD setup and added a release checklist.
- Added a release-safety script to require specs/dev log updates on schema changes.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Create the STAGING Firebase project and generate real `firebase_options_staging.dart`.
- Validate emulator and staging runs across target platforms.

# 🔹 Block 321 — Firebase macOS app registration (09/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Registered a dedicated macOS Firebase app and regenerated `firebase_options.dart`.
- Updated macOS bundle id to `com.marcdevelopez.focusinterval.macos`.
- Updated iOS/macOS GoogleService-Info.plist files and firebase.json via FlutterFire CLI.

### 🎯 Next steps:

# 🔹 Block 322 — Test updates for dataVersion (09/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated task-related tests to include `dataVersion` after schema versioning changes.

# 🔹 Block 323 — Emulator usage docs (09/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Documented emulator start commands and the Emulator UI URL in `docs/environments.md`.

# 🔹 Block 324 — Release GitHub OAuth command (09/02/2026)

# 🔹 Block 325 — README release OAuth command (09/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added the release + GitHub OAuth command to `README.md` for quick reference.

# 🔹 Block 326 — Groups Hub empty-state CTA (09/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Ensured the "Go to Task List" CTA remains visible in Groups Hub even when no groups exist.

# 🔹 Block 327 — Linux Account Mode rationale (09/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Documented why Linux desktop runs Local Mode only and how to use Web for Account Mode.

# 🔹 Block 328 — Staging setup checklist (10/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added `docs/staging_checklist.md` with a step-by-step STAGING project setup path.
- Clarified DEV/STAGING/PROD project mapping in `docs/environments.md`.

# 🔹 Block 329 — Staging billing plan note (10/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Documented that STAGING currently uses Spark and should be upgraded to Blaze only if needed.

# 🔹 Block 330 — Sync + lifecycle stabilization (10/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated specs with activeSession fields (`currentTaskStartedAt`, `pausedAt`), time-range anchoring rules, pause offset persistence, resume resync, and ownership retry.
- Reopened Phase 18 items for lifecycle resync, task range anchoring, pause-offset persistence, and ownership retry.
- Added session schema fields (`currentTaskStartedAt`, `pausedAt`) and propagation in PomodoroViewModel + Firestore sync.
- Run Mode now persists pause offsets by extending TaskRunGroup.theoreticalEndTime on resume.
- Run Mode resyncs on AppLifecycleState.resumed and gates controls while syncing; TimerScreen avoids transient Ready by showing a sync loader.
- Ownership request UI allows retry when a pending request exceeds the stale threshold.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Use TaskRunGroup.theoreticalEndTime as the authoritative pause-offset accumulator for task ranges.
- Keep phaseStartedAt for progress only; task ranges anchor to actualStartTime + accumulated offsets.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- `tools/check_release_safety.sh` failed before the dev log update (expected); passed after adding this block.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-run `tools/check_release_safety.sh` after dev log update.
- Validate sync + ownership transfer scenarios on macOS/Android (release builds).

# 🔹 Block 331 — Run Mode sync UI safeguards (10/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a Syncing state in Run Mode when `activeSession` is temporarily missing while a group is running.
- Added manual refresh in Run Mode (AppBar sync icon) to trigger `syncWithRemoteSession()`.
- Hid ownership indicator and contextual task list while syncing to avoid showing stale ranges.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-test macOS sleep/wake + Android mirror to confirm no duplicate owner state appears.

# 🔹 Block 332 — Firestore rules deploy requirement (11/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Documented that any new Firestore collection/path requires updating `firestore.rules`
  and redeploying rules/indexes (AGENTS, release safety, Copilot instructions).

# 🔹 Block 333 — Ownership sync guard + UI refresh (11/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Guarded activeSession publishes to prevent non-owners from overwriting `ownerDeviceId`.
- Triggered UI refresh when ownership metadata changes (owner/device or request) even if state is unchanged.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-test ownership transfer while the prior owner is backgrounded/asleep on macOS + Android mirror.

# 🔹 Block 334 — Desktop inactive resync keepalive (11/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a periodic inactive resync in Account Mode to surface ownership requests and avoid stale controls on desktop.
- Documented the inactive resync keepalive behavior in the Run Mode sync specs.

# 🔹 Block 335 — Ownership auto-claim + resync hardening (11/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Lowered the stale ownership threshold to 45s and documented the new rule.
- Enabled auto-claim on stale owner without requiring a manual request.
- Added post-request resync after approve/reject/request to remove transient control mismatches.
- Updated scheduled session staleness checks to align with the new threshold.

# 🔹 Block 336 — Paused ownership stability + Android paused heartbeats (11/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Limited auto-claim to running sessions; paused sessions only auto-claim when a pending requester is stale.
- Added Android owner heartbeats during paused state via ForegroundService.
- Documented paused ownership stability rules in specs.

# 🔹 Block 337 — Ownership API hardening (11/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Split ownership request vs auto-claim responsibilities (request never changes owner).
- Made auto-claim status-aware inside the transaction (running vs paused).
- Added owner-only clearSession path plus explicit stale/invalid cleanup helpers.

# 🔹 Block 338 — Stale null guard for ownership (11/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Treated missing `lastUpdatedAt` as **not stale** to avoid auto-claim/cleanup
  during server-timestamp propagation.
- Applied the guard consistently in auto-claim and stale-cleanup paths.

# 🔹 Block 339 — Paused expiry guard + verification (11/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Deferred running-group expiry until the activeSession stream has emitted at least once
  to prevent paused sessions from being completed on resume.
- Added debug logs at the expiry decision points (sanitize + coordinator).
- Added coordinator tests to assert paused sessions never complete and to cover the
  stream-loading race.

# 🔹 Block 340 — Active-session expiry guards (11/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Prevented running-group expiry when `activeSession` is missing or not running.
- Required groupId match between activeSession and the running group to allow expiry.
- Expanded expiry logs with session/group ids, running/stale flags, and end delta.
- Added tests for `null -> paused` session snapshots and cross-group running sessions.

# 🔹 Block 341 — Repo auto-complete removal (11/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Removed repository-level auto-complete-on-read for expired running groups.
- Confirmed expiry is enforced only by coordinator/viewmodel guards.
- Added repo-level debug logs for expired running groups without mutating status.
- Added tests ensuring repos do not auto-complete without session context.

# 🔹 Block 342 — Ownership request resync on resume (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Forced session stream re-subscription on resume to surface pending ownership
  requests after background/sleep.
- Added a short post-resume resync to catch delayed Firestore snapshots.
- Ensured resync updates trigger UI refresh when ownership metadata changes.

# 🔹 Block 343 — Optimistic ownership pending indicator (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added optimistic pending state for ownership requests so the requester sees
  the amber indicator immediately after tapping Request.
- Cleared optimistic state once the stream confirms the request or ownership
  changes, keeping UI derived from the activeSession snapshot.
- Documented the optimistic pending indicator behavior in specs.

# 🔹 Block 344 — Ownership reject prompt dismiss (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Dismissed the owner-side ownership request prompt immediately on reject
  to match accept behavior (optimistic UI).
- Added a per-request dismissal key to avoid waiting for remote snapshot latency.
- Documented immediate dismiss behavior in specs.

# 🔹 Block 345 — Ownership reject flicker guard (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Prevented the reject prompt from reappearing due to transient `activeSession`
  gaps by keeping the dismissal until the request resolves.
- Cleared the dismissal only when the same requester’s request is no longer pending.

# 🚀 End of file

# 🔹 Block 346 — Ownership stream unification + gating (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Clarified specs for scheduled auto-start ownership (first device wins),
  Pre-Run cancel exception, always-visible ownership indicator (syncing variant),
  and removed manual sync from Run Mode.
- PomodoroViewModel now listens to the shared activeSession stream
  (`pomodoroSessionStreamProvider`) to keep VM/UI snapshots aligned.
- Added session-missing tracking while a group is running, preserving last-known
  session state while disabling controls during sync gaps.
- Hardened control gating in Account Mode: requires a valid session snapshot,
  disables during sync gaps, allows initial start when no session exists yet,
  and allows Pre-Run cancel on all devices.
- TimerScreen now uses VM session snapshots for ownership UI, shows a syncing
  ownership indicator when needed, disables request actions while syncing, and
  removed the AppBar manual sync button.

# 🔹 Block 347 — Session-missing gating + neutral indicator (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Treat `group running + session null` as syncing unconditionally to avoid
  enabling controls before activeSession arrives.
- Added auto-start path that syncs first and only starts when no session exists,
  preventing duplicate starts while keeping scheduled/start-now flows working.
- Ownership indicator now distinguishes real syncing vs "no session yet" (neutral),
  and disables ownership actions when there is no session.

# 🔹 Block 348 — Sync-gap neutralization (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Removed unreachable duplicate branch in session-null handling.
- Neutralized `activeSessionForCurrentGroup` during sync gaps so mirror/owner
  derivations do not rely on stale snapshots while syncing.

# 🔹 Block 349 — Pending indicator priority (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Made the ownership pending indicator override syncing/no-session visuals so
  the requester stays amber immediately after tapping Request.
- Kept request button disabled during sync gaps while preserving the
  "Request sent" status text.

# 🔹 Block 350 — Preserve optimistic request on mirror switch (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Prevented \_resetLocalSessionState from clearing optimistic ownership when
  switching from owner to mirror while a local request is pending.
- This keeps the requester indicator amber without flicker until the owner
  approves or rejects.

# 🔹 Block 351 — Optimistic request precedence over stale rejection (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Prevented optimistic pending state from being cleared by an older rejected
  ownershipRequest snapshot (keeps requester indicator amber until confirmed).
- OwnershipRequest getter now prefers optimistic pending when the remote request
  is older than the local request.

# 🔹 Block 352 — Optimistic request kept over stale rejected (other requester) (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Stopped clearing optimistic pending when the remote ownershipRequest is a
  rejected request from another device (stale rejection should not override
  a fresh local request).
- Prefers optimistic pending when a rejected request lacks timestamps,
  avoiding flicker before Firestore writes the new pending request.

# 🔹 Block 353 — Local pending gating for request UI (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added an explicit local pending flag for ownership requests so the requester
  stays in "Request sent" immediately after tapping, even if snapshots lag.
- Request button gating now respects local pending to prevent double taps while
  the request is in-flight.

# 🔹 Block 354 — Ownership requestId for optimistic reconciliation (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added `requestId` to ownership requests and propagated it through the
  Firestore request + rejection flow.
- Optimistic pending now matches by requestId to ignore stale rejected requests,
  preventing the request indicator from flashing back to mirror.

# 🔹 Block 355 — Pending UI held until owner responds (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Requester pending UI no longer clears due to intermediate snapshots.
- Local pending is cleared only when the owner responds (accepted or rejected)
  or when another device has a pending request.

# 🔹 Block 356 — Request action moved into ownership sheet (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Removed the mirror-side “Request” button from the main control row.
- Ownership requests are now initiated only from the AppBar ownership sheet
  to reduce inconsistent UI states and simplify the flow.

# 🔹 Block 357 — Retry CTA moved to ownership sheet (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added the **Retry** label to the ownership sheet action when a pending request
  exceeds the stale threshold.
- Keeps the retry path available without reintroducing a main control-row button.

# 🔹 Block 358 — CRITICAL: Ownership request UI locked + stable (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Ownership request action moved to the AppBar ownership sheet only; mirror
  control row no longer shows a Request button.
- Requester pending UI now stays stable (no revert) until the owner responds.
- This UX flow is now a **locked requirement** in specs to prevent regressions.

# 🔹 Block 359 — Fix reject + retry state reset (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Cleared local pending when a rejection arrives for the same requester.
- Ownership request keys now use requestId when available, so new requests
  are not suppressed after a prior rejection.

# 🔹 Block 360 — Reject modal dismissal stabilized (12/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Prevented the owner-side reject modal from reappearing due to requestId
  materializing after the initial tap by dismissing via requesterId as well.
- Dismissal now clears only when the request resolves, avoiding flicker.

# 🔹 Block 361 — Reject modal source unified (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Ownership request dismissal + rejection snackbar now derive from the
  ViewModel session only (removed mixed stream source).
- This prevents the owner-side reject modal from reappearing after a reject
  due to stale stream/Vm timing mismatches.

# 🔹 Block 362 — Allow repeat requests after reject (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Dismiss suppression now keys off requestId when available; requesterId is
  only used for legacy requests without requestId.
- This ensures a new request from the same mirror is visible to the owner
  and is not blocked by a previous dismissal.

# 🔹 Block 363 — Preserve new pending over old rejection (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- A new ownership request no longer loses its pending state when a previous
  rejection still exists in the remote session.
- Reconciliation now compares requestId (or timestamps for legacy requests),
  so the mirror indicator stays amber immediately after re-requesting.

# 🔹 Block 364 — Ownership request UX postmortem & lock-in (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Final root cause identified: **optimistic pending was cleared by an older
  rejection** because requestId was not used to reconcile snapshots.
- Reinforced reconciliation rules in ViewModel and specs:
  - Rejections apply **only** to the same requestId.
  - New requests from the same device must remain pending immediately.
- Earlier failed attempts (documented for future maintenance):
  - Dismiss-by-requesterId blocked future requests (fixed by requestId scoping).
  - Mixed stream vs VM dismissal caused the owner modal to reappear (unified to VM).
  - Removing the control-row Request button reduced transient UI divergence.
- Tests added to lock the expected behavior and prevent regressions.

### 🧠 Lessons captured:

- Ownership UI must derive from **one source of truth** (VM) to avoid flicker.
- `requestId` is mandatory for reliable optimistic sync; legacy timestamps are
  only a fallback.

# 🔹 Block 365 — Auto-dismiss rejection snackbar on state change (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Rejection snackbar now auto-clears when the requester either becomes owner
  or sends a new pending request, preventing stale UI.
- Kept snackbar non-blocking with OK, but ensured it never lingers over a
  successful ownership transition.

# 🔹 Block 366 — Selection-scoped task weight (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated specs to make task weight selection-scoped and hide Task weight (%)
  when the task is not selected.
- Added a domain helper + unit tests for normalized task weight percentages.
- Added selection-scoped weight providers and wired Task List to them.
- Updated Task Editor to show Task weight (%) only for selected tasks,
  redistribute within the selected set, and add an info modal + info icon.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Task weight percentages are derived only from the selected task group;
  unselected tasks are never impacted by weight edits.
- The educational modal follows the existing “Don’t show again” pattern and
  remains accessible via the info icon.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate weight behavior across selection scenarios (1 task = 100%, 2 tasks = 50/50),
  plus Edit Task visibility and redistribution boundaries.

# 🔹 Block 367 — Hold mirror state during session gaps (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a session-gap guard in PomodoroViewModel so recent active sessions keep
  Run Mode in a syncing state instead of dropping to Ready.
- Missing activeSession now checks the previous session + lastUpdatedAt before
  clearing mirror state, preventing transient gaps from resetting the timer.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat a missing activeSession as a **sync gap** when the last known session is
  active and within the stale threshold; prefer Syncing UI over Ready.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Android mirror briefly rendered Ready while activeSession was still running
  on the owner (session snapshot gap).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate on Android mirror that session gaps show Syncing instead of Ready,
  including background/foreground and app-switch scenarios.

# 🔹 Block 368 — Allow Local Mode switch from login (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Enabled the Account/Local mode chip on the Login screen to switch into
  Local Mode and return to the Task List when Account Mode is active.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Login should honor “switch between Local and Account at any time” by allowing
  a direct Local Mode exit even before sign-in.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Verify on Chrome and iOS that tapping the mode chip exits to Local Mode.

# 🔹 Block 369 — Noop streams emit empty lists (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated Noop task, task run group, and preset repositories to emit an empty
  list immediately instead of never emitting.
- Unblocked Task List / Groups Hub / Preset screens from staying in a perpetual
  loading state when Account Mode has no signed-in user or sync disabled.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Noop repositories must always emit an initial empty list so empty-state UI
  renders instead of a stuck syncing indicator.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate on macOS that fresh installs show the empty states + sign-in CTA
  instead of loading spinners in Account Mode with no user.

# 🔹 Block 370 — Add centralized bug log (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added docs/bug_log.md to centralize bug tracking.
- Seeded the log with BUG-001 (mirror Ready with active session) and marked it intermittent.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Bug notes live in docs/bug_log.md; dev log references them only when tied to code changes.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Add new bug reports to docs/bug_log.md in chronological order.

# 🔹 Block 371 — Add feature backlog (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added docs/feature_backlog.md to centralize feature ideas.
- Seeded IDEA-001 (circular group progress ring around the timer).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Feature ideas live in docs/feature_backlog.md with a consistent template.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Add the remaining feature ideas using the same template.

# 🔹 Block 372 — Document ownership desync + mirror flicker bugs (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added BUG-002 and BUG-003 to docs/bug_log.md, splitting ownership rejection
  desync from macOS mirror flicker.
- Expanded evidence with key Firestore timestamps and observed sequences.
- Updated bug log template to include Repro steps, Workaround, and optional
  device/role/snapshot details.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Separate root-cause candidates into distinct bug entries for targeted fixes.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Ownership rejection can leave Android in Ready despite activeSession running.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate BUG-002 on Android after any ownership UI changes.

# 🔹 Block 373 — Split ownership bugs and add timer drift/inactive window issues (13/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Refined BUG-002 with clearer ownership-requested UI symptoms and evidence.
- Added BUG-004 (mirror timer drift during long breaks).
- Added BUG-005 (macOS inactive window hides ownership requests).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Separate ownership-handling failures from time-drift and desktop-focus issues
  to isolate root causes.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Mirror time drift can grow over long phases.
- macOS may miss ownership requests while inactive.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate BUG-004 and BUG-005 after ownership resync changes.

# 🔹 Block 374 — Add delayed-retry rejection evidence to BUG-002 (14/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Expanded BUG-002 with delayed Retry delivery and post-Groups Hub snapshot
  showing rejected ownershipRequest while session runs.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep delayed-retry evidence under BUG-002 to avoid fragmenting ownership
  desync root-cause analysis.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Firestore can retain rejected ownershipRequest after UI resync.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-validate BUG-002 after ownership-request handling changes.

# 🔹 Block 375 — Define scheduling conflict resolution rules (14/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Documented late-start overlap handling, overdue scheduled group queue, and
  long-pause conflict resolution in `docs/specs.md`.
- Added owner-only decision rules with auto-claim on conflict flows.
- Introduced `canceledReason` for canceled groups (interrupted/conflict/missed)
  and Groups Hub labeling guidance.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Conflicts caused by delayed starts or long pauses always require explicit user
  choice; no silent auto-cancellation.
- Overdue scheduled groups are queued by user-selected order; the first starts
  immediately while subsequent groups preserve pre-run windows.
- Paused/running overlap decisions count as normal pauses and must be resolved
  by the owner.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement and validate the new conflict-resolution flows in Run Mode and
  planning/Groups Hub surfaces.

# 🔹 Block 376 — Refine late-start conflict chooser behavior (14/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated the late-start conflict chooser to allow selecting one group or
  selecting none, with explicit confirmation for canceling all conflicts.
- Clarified single-selection behavior in the chooser flow.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Late-start conflicts remain owner-only; user can explicitly choose to cancel
  all conflicting groups instead of being forced to pick one.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Verify the conflict chooser UX aligns with the catch-up queue expectations.

# 🔹 Block 377 — Allow multi-select ordering in late-start conflicts (14/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated the late-start conflict chooser to allow multi-select + reordering
  of conflicting groups, with sequential execution and preserved pre-run windows.
- Clarified that unselected conflicting groups are canceled with reason
  `conflict`.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Late-start conflicts use a queue-like selection: the first starts immediately
  (no pre-run), subsequent selections keep their pre-run windows.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Ensure the conflict chooser preview reflects updated projected ranges and
  revalidation rules.

# 🔹 Block 378 — Unify late-start overlap flows (14/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Unified late-start overlap handling into a single full-screen queue flow.
- Removed the separate late-start chooser variant; the queue now covers one or
  more overdue overlaps with the same multi-select + reorder logic.
- Clarified cancel-reason rules for overdue vs future-scheduled groups.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Late-start overlap resolution uses one consistent UX path to reduce logic
  branches and bug surface area.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate the unified flow against all late-start overlap cases.

# 🔹 Block 379 — Add write-safety rules for conflict resolution (14/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added atomic write requirements for multi-group cancel/reschedule flows.
- Required resume to update TaskRunGroup + activeSession atomically, blocking
  resume on failure to prevent time drift.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Conflict-resolution flows must not proceed on partial writes; retries are
  mandatory before starting or resuming groups.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Ensure implementation uses batch/transaction writes for conflict resolution
  and resume updates.

# 🔹 Block 380 — Log status box pause anchoring bug (14/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added BUG-006 to docs/bug_log.md for status-box time ranges that ignore pause
  anchoring, to align with contextual task list behavior.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat status-box time range inconsistency as a bug (not a feature request).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Pause/resume can shift status-box ranges retroactively instead of forward-only.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate BUG-006 once Run Mode time-range calculations are reviewed.

# 🔹 Block 381 — Merge Android request delay into BUG-005 (14/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Expanded BUG-005 to include the Android receiver variant where ownership
  requests only surface after navigating to Groups Hub.
- Removed the duplicate BUG-007 entry to keep ownership request issues unified.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep ownership request delays under a single bug with platform variants.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Android can miss ownership requests until a manual navigation refresh.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate BUG-005 variants alongside other ownership-request resync fixes.

# 🔹 Block 382 — Add Ready->Run context to BUG-005 (14/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added context to BUG-005 noting a brief Ready screen on macOS mirror before
  the ownership request (macOS -> Android) failed to surface, then a tap
  restored the running timer.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep the Ready->Run context under BUG-005 Variant B to preserve the full
  ownership-request timeline.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- macOS mirror can show Ready briefly before an ownership request is missed on
  Android.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate whether the Ready->Run flicker correlates with missed requests.

# 🔹 Block 383 — Add owner background resubscribe detail (14/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added BUG-005 Variant B detail: background/foreground on the Android owner
  surfaces the pending ownership request after the Ready->Run recovery.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat background/foreground as another resubscribe trigger for the same bug.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Ownership requests can remain hidden until the owner app resubscribes.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate whether resume listeners consistently surface pending requests.

# 🔹 Block 384 — Note Ready recovery without request delay (14/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added BUG-005 Variant B context where macOS mirror showed Ready briefly, then
  recovered on click and the ownership request to Android surfaced immediately.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Document that Ready-state flicker does not always correlate with request delay.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Ready-state recovery can still coexist with correct request delivery.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate if Ready-state flicker and request delay have separate triggers.

# 🔹 Block 385 — Clarify plan group auto-rebase wording (15/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated IDEA-016 in `docs/feature_backlog.md` to state that scheduled previews
  auto-rebase to the nearest valid start when pre-run becomes stale, with a
  warning and conflict gating.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Scheduled plan previews must remain confirmable by auto-updating stale start
  times (now + noticeMinutes) and warning the user.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-016/017 once wording is approved.

# 🔹 Block 386 — Add paused task range live update idea (15/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added IDEA-018 to `docs/feature_backlog.md` for live pause updates of task
  time ranges in Run Mode (task list under the timer).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat pause-time range updates as a UI consistency improvement (no business
  logic changes).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-018 on its own branch.

# 🔹 Block 387 — Add break tasks list idea (15/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added IDEA-019 to `docs/feature_backlog.md` for a Break tasks list in Run Mode
  with break-only completion and local per-user persistence.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep Break tasks as a UI/UX feature without changes to TaskRunGroup logic.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-019 on its own branch.

# 🔹 Block 388 — Add break-only quick chip behavior (15/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Expanded IDEA-019 to surface the next break task as a chip during breaks,
  with a quick Yes/Not yet completion modal.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep the quick chip visible only in break phases; pomodoros show the icon only.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push the updated IDEA-019.

# 🔹 Block 389 — Add optional break tasks sharing notes (15/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Expanded IDEA-019 to clarify device-only visibility by default and an optional
  share-to-active-devices flow with recipient acceptance and id-based dedupe.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep sharing explicit and opt-in; no background sync for break tasks.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push the updated IDEA-019 if approved.

# 🔹 Block 390 — Clarify pomodoro completion restriction rationale (15/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated IDEA-019 to explain that break-task completion is disabled during
  pomodoros to protect focus time.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Completion gating rationale must be explicit in the visual states section.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-019 once approved.

# 🔹 Block 391 — Clarify break tasks sharing scope (15/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated IDEA-019 to allow sharing either the full break-task list or selected
  items when sending to active devices.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Share flow must support subset sharing, not just full list transfer.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-019 once approved.

# 🔹 Block 392 — Add scheduled-by field idea (15/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added IDEA-020 to `docs/feature_backlog.md` for showing scheduledByDeviceId
  in Group Summary with a legacy fallback.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat scheduled-by visibility as a UI-only traceability improvement.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-020 on its own branch.

# 🔹 Block 393 — Add account deletion idea (16/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added IDEA-021 to `docs/feature_backlog.md` for an Account Mode "Delete account"
  action with explicit destructive confirmation.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep deletion flow as a UI/UX entry that must align with provider and backend
  deletion rules (no behavior change beyond exposure and safe flow).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-021 on its own branch.

# 🔹 Block 394 — Add verified presence + heatmap idea (16/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added IDEA-022 to `docs/feature_backlog.md` for pomodoro presence verification
  and a GitHub-style activity heatmap (personal vs workspace).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Presence confirmation is a lightweight banner at pomodoro boundaries and only
  verified pomodoros count toward the heatmap.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-022 on its own branch.

# 🔹 Block 395 — Clarify backlog scope/priority legend (16/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated the feature backlog template to document Scope (S/M/L) and Priority
  (P0/P1/P2) meanings.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep the legend inline with the template for quick reference.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push along with IDEA-022 if approved.

# 🔹 Block 396 — Add resume canceled groups idea (16/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added IDEA-023 to `docs/feature_backlog.md` for resuming canceled groups while
  keeping Re-plan as an alternative.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat Resume as a behavior change that requires a spec update before any
  implementation.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-023 on its own branch.

# 🔹 Block 394 — Add mirror desync after resync/phase change (16/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Expanded BUG-004 with a new scenario: mirror desync after Ready->Run recovery,
  ownership acceptance, and a phase change; pause/resume preserves the offset
  until another mirror device resubscribes.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat this as additional evidence for mirror timer drift rather than a new bug.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Mirror offset can persist across phase changes and survive pause/resume.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate whether resubscribe or phase-change handling re-bases mirror timers.

# 🔹 Block 395 — Add Ready screen recurrence to BUG-001 (16/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Expanded BUG-001 with a 16/02/2026 occurrence: Android mirror showed Ready
  during Pomodoro 2 after backgrounding; resynced only after Groups Hub
  navigation, despite macOS owner running.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat this as additional evidence for the mirror Ready-with-session bug.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Mirror Ready screen can recur after background/resume without ownership changes.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-validate BUG-001 after any session-gap handling changes.

# 🔹 Block 396 — Add ownership revert workaround to BUG-002 (16/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Expanded BUG-002 with a 16/02/2026 scenario: mirror Ready after background,
  ownership accepted but reverted unless Run Mode was refreshed quickly.
- Documented the short-window Groups Hub refresh workaround (~20–30s) that
  stabilizes ownership.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat the ownership revert as part of the existing desync bug.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Ownership can revert to the previous owner unless a fast resubscribe occurs.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate whether resubscribe timing prevents ownership rollback.

# 🔹 Block 397 — Add post-ownership timer offset detail (16/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added BUG-002 follow-up: after ownership stabilized on Android, macOS mirror
  showed ~5 seconds less remaining (mirror ahead).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Track small post-ownership offsets under the same desync bug.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Mirror can remain a few seconds behind even after ownership stabilizes.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Verify whether ownership stabilization also re-bases mirror timers.

# 🔹 Block 398 — Add mirror pulsing + growing drift detail (16/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added BUG-002 follow-up: mirror drift grows over time and macOS UI pulses
  between synced and offset timers once per second during the break.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Track pulsing UI and growing drift under the same ownership desync bug.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Mirror can oscillate between two timer projections while drifting.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Check for competing projections or duplicate timer sources on mirror.

# 🔹 Block 399 — Note Groups Hub resync after pulsing (16/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added BUG-002 detail: navigating to Groups Hub and back re-synchronizes the
  mirror with the owner/Firebase after pulsing/drift.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep resync behavior documented under the same desync bug.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Manual navigation remains the reliable recovery path.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Verify if automatic resubscribe can replace manual Groups Hub refresh.

# 🔹 Block 400 — Add workspace shared groups idea (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added IDEA-024 to `docs/feature_backlog.md` for Workspaces with shared
  TaskRunGroups, ownership rules, and personal-overlap conflict gating.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat Workspaces as a large-scope product/architecture feature that depends
  on new Firestore collections and explicit conflict-resolution rules.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-024 on its own branch.

# 🔹 Block 401 — Add workspace owner-request option (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated IDEA-024 to allow an optional setting where members can request
  workspace run ownership if the owner enables it.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep ownership requests opt-in per workspace and require explicit approval.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-024 update.

# 🔹 Block 402 — Switch to auto-ownership option (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated IDEA-024 to specify an optional setting for automatic member
  ownership (no approval) when the workspace owner enables it.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Auto-ownership is opt-in per workspace and replaces approval-based requests.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-024 update.

# 🔹 Block 403 — Clarify workspace shared group scheduling (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated IDEA-024 to state that shared workspace groups have no start time
  until the owner schedules them, so conflicts only apply after scheduling.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep multiple shared groups unscheduled until the owner assigns exact starts.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-024 update.

# 🔹 Block 404 — Add workspace break chat idea (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added IDEA-025 to `docs/feature_backlog.md` for break-focused workspace chat,
  including deferred DM delivery and data-efficient sync rules.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Chat is text-only in this phase; delivery and visibility are gated by run
  break phases to avoid focus disruption.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-025 on its own branch.

# 🔹 Block 405 — Clarify workspace chat vs DM scope (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated IDEA-025 to explicitly call out a workspace-wide group chat plus
  member-to-member direct messages.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep both chat modes text-only and break-focused in this phase.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push the IDEA-025 clarification.

# 🔹 Block 406 — Clarify out-of-run chat access (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated IDEA-025 to allow workspace chat and DMs outside runs, with no inbound
  delivery/notifications during pomodoro focus time.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep pomodoro focus time free of incoming chat delivery; queue until break.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push the IDEA-025 update.

# 🔹 Block 407 — Clarify pomodoro vs break delivery semantics (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Tightened IDEA-025 to state that inbound messages are not visible during
  pomodoros and become visible at the next break; out-of-run behaves normally.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- "Receive" explicitly means "becomes visible" to avoid focus disruption.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push the IDEA-025 clarification.

# 🔹 Block 408 — Add total-time Ready recurrence to BUG-001 (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Expanded BUG-001 with a total-time planning scenario where macOS mirror shows
  Ready during a running group and only resyncs after tap or Groups Hub navigation.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep this under the mirror Ready-with-session bug as additional evidence.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Mirror can remain in Ready across multiple phases without auto-resync.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-validate mirror Ready recovery paths in Run Mode.

# 🔹 Block 409 — Add Manage Presets item UX idea (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added IDEA-026 to `docs/feature_backlog.md` for consistent Manage Presets item
  preview, star placement, and tap/long-press behavior.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Align preset item gestures with Task List: tap edits, long-press selects.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-026 on its own branch.

# 🔹 Block 410 — Add unified mode indicator idea (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added IDEA-027 to `docs/feature_backlog.md` for consistent mode indicator
  placement and a single session-context sheet across screens.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep logout and account context inside the mode sheet/Settings to clean
  AppBars.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-027 on its own branch.

# 🔹 Block 411 — Add verified activity summary idea (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added IDEA-028 to `docs/feature_backlog.md` for verified weekly/monthly totals,
  task breakdowns, and a Week-start setting aligned with IDEA-022.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Only verified pomodoros count toward totals and breakdowns.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-028 on its own branch.

# 🔹 Block 412 — Add live pause time ranges idea (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added IDEA-029 to `docs/feature_backlog.md` for live pause time ranges that
  update forward-only during paused state.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Pause offsets must never rewrite past start times; only forward ranges move.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit and push IDEA-029 on its own branch.

# 🔹 Block 413 — Log owner resume drift after background crash (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Logged BUG-007 in `docs/bug_log.md` for owner resume drift after an Android
  background crash (owner behind mirror by ~5s) and manual resync recovery.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Track this as a distinct sync/ownership correctness issue with resume
  re-anchoring as the likely root cause.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Investigate resume re-anchoring and add instrumentation/tests before fix.

# 🔹 Block 414 — Ownership sync hardening (server fetch + gap handling) (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added server-preferred activeSession fetch and used it on resume/inactive resync.
- Added session snapshot tracking to hold “Syncing session...” during gaps.
- Added debug instrumentation for activeSession snapshots and missing holds.
- Added unit test covering session-gap hold when lastUpdatedAt is missing.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Prefer server snapshots for resume and inactive keepalive to surface ownership
  changes promptly and avoid stale cached reads.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate on Android + macOS with real devices (owner background/resume, request
  flows, mirror drift scenarios).

# 🔹 Block 415 — Short ownership request validation (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Ran a short manual test: Android mirror requested ownership while macOS owner
  was in background (app hidden). On bringing macOS to foreground, the request
  appeared immediately and was accepted; Android obtained ownership correctly
  (UI + Firestore).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat this as a positive short-session validation only; longer/pause-heavy
  scenarios still need coverage before closing BUG-005/BUG-002.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run a long-pause test (2–3h) with both devices backgrounded; report any
  desync or ownership regressions.

# 🔹 Block 416 — Background auto-claim validation (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Ran a manual test with both devices backgrounded during a scheduled run:
  Android requested and obtained ownership, then both devices went to
  background. On resume, macOS auto-claimed as owner (stale owner rule) and
  Firestore reflected the same ownerDeviceId and running state.
- Verified Firestore snapshot during resume showed consistent fields:
  ownerDeviceId = macOS, status = shortBreakRunning, phaseStartedAt and
  lastUpdatedAt populated, remainingSeconds aligned.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat this as a positive validation of auto-claim rules when owner is stale.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Capture precise timestamps (owner before/after, lastUpdatedAt, status) on
  long-pause tests to confirm no regressions.

# 🔹 Block 417 — Pause resume snapshot validation (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Captured Firestore snapshot before resume with both devices backgrounded:
  ownerDeviceId = android, status = paused, pausedAt = 20:20:03, remainingSeconds = 360.
- Captured snapshot after resume (≈15s later): ownerDeviceId = android,
  status = pomodoroRunning, lastUpdatedAt = 20:43:09, phaseStartedAt = 20:24:08,
  remainingSeconds = 359.
- Ownership remained on Android; session resumed without drift.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat this as a positive validation for owner stability after a backgrounded
  pause (no auto-flip to macOS in this scenario).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-test with a longer pause window if any regression appears.

# 🔹 Block 418 — Clarify pause duration (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Clarification: the previous validation pause lasted ~20 minutes (approx).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat the pause duration as approximate; use Firestore timestamps for exact
  deltas in future logs.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- None.

# 🔹 Block 419 — Owner heartbeat during session gaps (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Logged BUG-008 for unexpected owner auto-claim while Android owner was in
  foreground (owner became stale and macOS auto-claimed).
- Updated PomodoroViewModel to allow owner heartbeats while the session stream
  is missing (syncing) to prevent stale ownership during gaps.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat missing-session gaps as a UI-sync state only; owner heartbeats must
  continue when the last known snapshot says this device is owner.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-test foreground owner stability during stream gaps (no auto-claim).

# 🔹 Block 420 — Add macOS local reset commands to README (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a dedicated "Local reset (macOS)" section to `README.md` with clean
  test commands and Keychain cleanup guidance.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep reset steps in README for quick access during device sync testing.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- None.

# 🔹 Block 421 — Foreground owner stability validation (alt account) (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Ran the foreground owner stability test on a different account:
  - Android started the run and remained owner.
  - macOS opened for observation only (no request).
  - After 2–3 minutes with Android in foreground, Firestore still showed
    ownerDeviceId = android and lastUpdatedAt advancing.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat this as a positive validation for the foreground owner heartbeat path.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Failures still appear after long pauses or backgrounding; those scenarios
  remain the priority for reproductions.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Continue long-pause/background tests on the original account to reproduce
  ownership flips or retry/accept loops.

# 🔹 Block 422 — Long background validations + ownership loop (17/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Ran long pause + both background test (60–90 min): owner stayed Android after
  resume; activeSession remained consistent.
- Ran running session + both background test (30–45 min): owner stayed Android
  after reopening; no ownership flip.
- Ran ownership request after long background (macOS owner, Android requester):
  accept briefly flipped owner to Android, then reverted to macOS within
  ~15–20 seconds; retry/accept loop persisted until Groups Hub navigation.
- Captured drift observation: macOS owner matched Firestore snapshot
  (`remainingSeconds = 1060` at 23:52:53 UTC+1), while Android showed fewer
  seconds and the gap appeared to grow until Groups Hub resync.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat the long-pause and running-background scenarios as positive
  validations for owner stability.
- Log the ownership loop as additional evidence for BUG-002.
- Log the growing drift observation under BUG-004 (possible clock skew /
  projection offset issue).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Ownership accept loops after long background; Android remains in requested/
  retry state and cannot retain ownership.
- Mirror drift grows over time with macOS owner; Android displays fewer seconds
  until a Groups Hub resync.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-test the ownership loop after the next build to confirm if fixes reduce
  reversion behavior.
- Capture system clock times on both devices during drift to confirm
  clock-skew vs projection error.

# 🔹 Block 423 — Drift growth confirmed with matched system clocks (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Captured drift evidence during long break with system clocks aligned:
  - 00:43:58 UTC+1: macOS 05:56 vs Android 05:14 (delta 42s).
  - 00:55:09 UTC+1: macOS 19:55 vs Android 19:02 (delta 53s).
- Confirmed the drift increased (~11s in ~11 minutes) while macOS remained
  owner, indicating a projection issue rather than clock skew.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat this as strong evidence for BUG-004 (growing mirror drift).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Drift grows over time even when device clocks match; Android shows fewer
  seconds than macOS.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Document a spec change for server-time offset projection before code changes.

# 🔹 Block 424 — Specs: server-time offset projection (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated `docs/specs.md` to require server-time offset projection for
  activeSession timers (derived from lastUpdatedAt).
- Clarified that projection must not use raw local clock alone and must
  rebase on ownership changes or new snapshots.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat the drift as a projection/rebase issue; fix via spec-first changes
  before any code updates.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement server-time offset projection in Run Mode after confirming the
  spec change is acceptable.

# 🔹 Block 425 — Implement server-time offset projection (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added server-time offset projection in `PomodoroViewModel` for activeSession
  timers (derived from lastUpdatedAt).
- Ensured projection reuses the last known offset when lastUpdatedAt is missing.
- Applied projection anchor consistently when rehydrating sessions and mirror
  updates.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep local-time projection only for Local Mode; Account Mode uses server
  offset when available.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate on device that mirror drift no longer grows during long breaks.

# 🔹 Block 426 — Keep Run Mode alive during active sessions (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a keep-alive link for `PomodoroViewModel` while an active session exists
  to avoid offset resets when navigating to Groups Hub.
- Tied keep-alive state to active execution or missing-session sync gaps.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Preserve the Run Mode VM in Account Mode during active sessions to keep
  heartbeat cadence and projection offsets stable across navigation.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(fill in when they happen)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-test Groups Hub navigation to confirm timers no longer gain seconds on
  return.

# 🔹 Block 427 — Groups Hub jump evidence captured (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Captured Firestore snapshots around Groups Hub navigation while running
  (macOS owner):
  - 02:03:54: remainingSeconds = 150 (before Groups Hub).
  - 02:04:24: remainingSeconds = 120 (2–5s after return).
  - 02:05:26: remainingSeconds = 60 (≈30s later).
- Reported that the returning device briefly showed more remaining seconds
  (timer jumped forward) despite Firestore continuing to count down.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat the jump as a navigation-induced offset reset; validate the keep-alive
  fix against this exact flow.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- UI jump on return from Groups Hub while running (pending fix validation).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-test the jump after the keep-alive change; confirm if the timer no longer
  adds seconds on return.

# 🔹 Block 428 — Suppress local machine timer in mirror mode (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a mirror-safe restore path that updates the session state without
  starting the local PomodoroMachine timer.
- Updated mirror projection to apply state via the new restore mode so the
  mirror relies exclusively on activeSession snapshots.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Mirror devices must not run the local PomodoroMachine timer; they only
  project from Firestore-derived session data.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Ownership request delivery can still require a Groups Hub resubscribe after
  multiple ownership changes and an owner pause (BUG-005).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate that mirror timer flicker and late sounds no longer occur after
  ownership handoff.

# 🔹 Block 429 — Split mirror flicker vs timer swap (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Separated the ~15s mirror pulse (BUG-003) from the per-second timer swap
  (BUG-009) to avoid conflating cosmetic refresh with the timer swap bug.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Track the per-second swap as a distinct bug with its own fix/validation path.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-test after the mirror timer suppression to confirm BUG-009 no longer appears.

# 🔹 Block 430 — Regression found: owner freezes after accept (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Logged a regression where ownership acceptance briefly flips to the requester,
  then reverts to the previous owner within seconds; requester UI freezes in
  requested state.
- Captured the Start Now scenario where Android did not auto-open Run Mode while
  macOS started the session.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Roll back the mirror timer suppression change and reassess ownership flow.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Ownership accept still reverts after a few seconds; requester remains stuck.
- Auto-open to Run Mode did not trigger for Android on Task List.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Revert the mirror suppression change on a dedicated branch.
- Re-test ownership acceptance and auto-open flow after rollback.

# 🔹 Block 431 — Ownership request delay (first delivery) validated (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Captured a delayed ownership request delivery on Android while paused:
  Firestore showed `ownershipRequest = pending` ~30s before Android surfaced it.
- Subsequent ownership requests and accepts succeeded without regressions in the
  same session.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat this as additional evidence for BUG-005 (request not surfaced until
  resubscribe/focus) rather than a new bug.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Initial ownership request delivery can lag even when both devices are active.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Continue testing background + long pause scenarios to isolate the trigger for
  delayed ownership delivery.

# 🔹 Block 432 — Add feature execution order list (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a "Recommended execution order" section to `docs/feature_backlog.md`
  while keeping idea entries in chronological order.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- New ideas remain appended at the end; the recommended order list will be
  updated as new ideas are added.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Revisit the order after ownership/sync bugs and Phase 17 validation close.

# 🔹 Block 433 — Document resync overlay mitigation (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a mitigation note to `docs/bug_log.md` proposing a Run Mode "Syncing..."
  overlay that mimics the Groups Hub resubscribe without navigation.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat this as a release fallback if ownership/sync bugs persist near MVP
  launch, while continuing to pursue root-cause fixes.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement only if needed for release stability and after specs approval.

# 🔹 Block 434 — Add pending request evidence after Ready (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Expanded BUG-005 with an 18/02/2026 case: macOS mirror recovered from Ready,
  but ownership requests remained pending in Firestore and did not surface on
  Android until Groups Hub navigation.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep this under ownership request surfacing failures (BUG-005).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Owner UI can miss pending requests even after mirror resync.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate whether owner-side listeners refresh on incoming requests.

# 🔹 Block 435 — Merge IDEA-018 into IDEA-029 (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Marked IDEA-018 as merged into IDEA-029 to avoid duplicate pause-range
  features in the backlog.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep IDEA-029 as the single source for live pause range updates (task list
  - status boxes).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Update the recommended execution order if needed after Phase 17 closes.

# 🔹 Block 436 — Restore IDEA-018 details while merged (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Restored IDEA-018 details while keeping it merged into IDEA-029.
- Expanded IDEA-029 with task-list cadence and batch-update details from
  IDEA-018 to preserve the full spec.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep IDEA-018 as a traceable sub-scope while IDEA-029 remains the unified
  source for pause-range behavior.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- None.

# 🔹 Block 437 — Phase 17 test coverage + workflow rule (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a mandatory pre-implementation high-level plan + risk review rule to
  `AGENTS.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Added ScheduledGroupCoordinator tests for late-start queue + running overlap
  decision; introduced a `@visibleForTesting` helper to evaluate overlap logic
  deterministically.
- Updated ownership/session-gap tests to wait for session readiness before
  asserting pending/missing states.
- `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` now pass.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Use a `@visibleForTesting` helper to validate overlap decision logic without
  relying on stream timing.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- None.

# 🔹 Block 438 — Account-scoped pre-run notice setting (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Documented account-scoped Pre-Run notice minutes in `docs/specs.md` and
  added the requirement to Phase 14; Phase 17 reopened items removed and
  formally closed in `docs/roadmap.md`.
- Added Settings UI for Pre-Run notice minutes and a small viewmodel to load
  and persist the value.
- Implemented Firestore-backed notice preference (per account) with local
  fallback; updated `firestore.rules` for `/users/{uid}/settings/*`.
- Added tests for the notice settings viewmodel.
- `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` pass.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Notice minutes are **per account** in Account Mode and **per device** in
  Local Mode; range capped at 0–15 minutes with default 5.
- Firestore settings document is additive; no backfill required (per
  `docs/release_safety.md`).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate cross-device sync of notice minutes on two signed-in devices.

# 🔹 Block 439 — Phase 17 reopen: early overlap warning + mirror CTA (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated specs for early running-overlap detection (pause drift) with break-based
  deferral rules and an explicit last-pomodoro exception.
- Added mirror UX requirements: persistent CTA in Groups Hub/Task List and a
  persistent conflict SnackBar requiring OK to dismiss.
- Reopened Phase 17 in the roadmap to track the new conflict-resolution scope.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Detect running overlap as soon as theoreticalEndTime crosses the next
  scheduled pre-run window (even before the pre-run starts).
- Defer the decision modal to breaks when possible; show immediately only on
  the final pomodoro.
- Mirror CTA copy uses “Owner seems unavailable…” and always allows a request.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement the early overlap warning + mirror CTA + persistent SnackBar.
- Add tests for the updated overlap detection timing and deferral rules.

# 🔹 Block 440 — Clarify overlap notification timing (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Refined the running-overlap timing rules to trigger the decision as soon as
  overlap becomes possible (runningEnd >= preRunStart), without waiting for
  a pomodoro-count threshold.
- Clarified break-first behavior with an explicit last-pomodoro exception.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Overlap detection starts at the moment it becomes possible; the UI only
  defers to the nearest allowed break unless there is no break left.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement the updated timing logic in the coordinator and TimerScreen.

# 🔹 Block 441 — Implement early overlap warning + mirror CTA (18/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Scheduled overlap detection now triggers as soon as runningEnd crosses the
  next pre-run start (no pre-run window gating), and mirrors receive the
  overlap signal for CTA/snackbar use.
- TimerScreen now defers the conflict modal to breaks, with an immediate
  exception for the final pomodoro.
- Added mirror conflict CTA + persistent SnackBar to Groups Hub and Task List.
- Added an ownership-request helper on the PomodoroViewModel for mirror CTAs.
- Updated overlap tests to cover pre-run-future detection and mirror devices.
- Ran `flutter analyze`.
- Ran `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/scheduled_group_coordinator_test.dart`.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Use the existing overlap decision provider for mirror UX signals, while
  keeping the modal owner-only via TimerScreen checks.
- SnackBars are persistent (no swipe dismissal) and require explicit OK.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate the new overlap timing and mirror CTA behavior on device.

# 🔹 Block 442 — Phase 17: auto-follow postpone + paused overlap timing (19/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated specs for postponed scheduling (postponedAfterGroupId), paused overlap
  projection, and postpone confirmation SnackBar copy.
- Implemented auto-follow postpone: scheduled groups track the running group’s
  projected end in real time and lock in the schedule when the anchor ends.
- Added paused overlap recheck scheduling so conflicts surface without waiting
  for resume.
- Updated Groups Hub and Task List to display effective scheduled timing and
  pre-run status for postponed groups.
- Postpone now confirms the new start time and pre-run time via SnackBar.
- Added overlap tests for paused projection and postponed-follow suppression.
- Ran `flutter analyze`.
- Ran `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/scheduled_group_coordinator_test.dart`.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Paused overlap decisions show immediately (no deferral).
- Effective schedule derives from anchor end + notice until it is finalized.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run the full test suite.
- Validate postpone flow on device (no repeat modal; schedule updates during
  pauses).

# 🔹 Block 443 — Phase 17: paused overlap recheck + cancel postponed schedule fix (19/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- ScheduledGroupCoordinator now re-evaluates overlaps on paused session heartbeats
  (no resume required) and avoids overriding canceled postponed groups.
- Cancel scheduled group now clears postponedAfterGroupId to prevent re-apply.
- Ran `flutter analyze`.
- Ran `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/scheduled_group_coordinator_test.dart`.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Use paused-session heartbeats (pausedAt/lastUpdatedAt) to trigger conflict
  evaluation while in foreground.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate pause-overlap and cancel-postponed flows on device.

# 🔹 Block 444 — Add break-start Ready recurrence (20/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Expanded BUG-001 with a 20/02/2026 recurrence: mirror shows Ready at break
  start and only re-syncs after tap on macOS or Groups Hub navigation on Android.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat break-start Ready as another recurrence of the mirror Ready bug.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Android mirror often requires Groups Hub navigation to recover.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate whether break transitions trigger session-gap handling.

# 🔹 Block 445 — Fix overdue late-start queue + navigation stability (20/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Late-start conflict detection moved to shared timing utilities.
- Coordinator now re-evaluates overdue queues immediately after clearing stale
  active sessions.
- Groups Hub “Start now” now redirects to late-start queue when overdue
  conflicts exist.
- Late-start confirm navigation now uses a delayed fallback to avoid duplicate
  transitions.
- Completion dialog suppressed when totals are empty (prevents 0/0/0 modal).
- Added unit test for 3 overdue scheduled groups.
- Updated bug log (BUG-008).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Prioritize late-start resolution over manual “Start now” when overdue
  conflicts exist and no running group is active.
- Avoid double navigation by letting the coordinator own the main transition.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate overdue late-start flow on Android (late-open scenario).
- Verify confirm flow navigates directly to Run Mode (no carousel).

# 🔹 Block 446 — Late-start queue ownership + live projections + chained postpone (20/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added late-start queue metadata fields (anchor, queue id/order, owner, claim).
- Implemented queue ownership claim/auto-claim and owner heartbeat updates.
- Late-start queue UI is now owner-only; mirrors are read-only with request CTA.
- Projections update live using a shared server timebase.
- Confirm queue now sets scheduledStartTime to queueNow, bootstraps activeSession,
  and clears queue owner/claim fields while keeping queue id/order for chaining.
- Postpone now chains queued groups sequentially and preserves notice/pre-run.
- copyWith now supports explicit null clearing for optional fields.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Use server heartbeat timebase for cross-device queue projections.
- Preserve lateStartQueueId/order on selected groups for chained postpone.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(not yet validated on devices)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate late-start owner flow + request/approve on macOS/Android.
- Confirm live projections align across devices.
- Exercise chained postpone with multiple queued groups.

# 🔹 Block 447 — Late-start auto-claim determinism + dispose guards (21/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Made late-start auto-claim deterministic when heartbeat is missing and anchor is stale.
- Added guard rails against ref use after dispose in coordinator async flow.
- Ensured late-start anchor is materialized when owner already has the queue.
- Extended coordinator tests with claim tracking + async wait to avoid race flakiness.
- Ran `flutter analyze` and `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/scheduled_group_coordinator_test.dart`.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Auto-claim is allowed when no owner exists or when owner heartbeat/anchor is stale.
- If owner is current device but anchor is missing, claim to seed the anchor.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none in automated tests)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Resume manual multi-device validation on macOS/Android (owner request / approve / no bounce).

# 🔹 Block 448 — Restore sticky Groups Hub CTA + regression guard (21/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Specs updated to require a sticky “Go to Task List” CTA outside the scrollable list.
- Roadmap reopened item added for the Groups Hub sticky CTA regression.
- Groups Hub now renders the CTA as a fixed header (always visible).
- Added AGENTS rule: do not degrade implemented UX without explicit owner approval.
- Ran `flutter analyze`.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep the mirror conflict banner inside the scrollable list; only the CTA is sticky.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate Groups Hub CTA remains visible while scrolling long lists.

# 🔹 Block 449 — Late-start ownership stability + overlap validity guards (22/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Specs: late-start queue scheduled range now shows date when not today.
- Late-start queue ownership: server-validated claim + heartbeat + request guards to prevent owner bounce.
- Late-start queue UI: auto-claim blocked when another requester is pending.
- Running overlap UI: added validity checks to suppress stale conflict banners/snackbars.
- Running overlap detection: treat end == pre-run start as non-overlap to avoid false conflicts.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Guard late-start ownership changes against pending requests and stale-owner checks using server state when possible.
- Validate overlap decisions at render time to avoid persistent UI after conflicts resolve.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-validate late-start ownership on macOS + Android with queued conflicts.
- Verify no stale overlap banners remain after rescheduling or completion.

# 🔹 Block 450 — ActiveSession missing recovery (22/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Specs: documented owner-only recovery when `activeSession` is missing during running/paused.
- PomodoroViewModel: added missing-session recovery (tryClaim + publish) with cooldown.
- Enabled heartbeats while syncing when the local machine is actively executing.
- Triggered recovery on stream/resync missing snapshots.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Recovery is allowed only when the local machine is running/paused and the group is running.
- Mirrors never publish during missing-session recovery.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(not yet validated on devices)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate activeSession recovery during late-start queue confirm + running/paused flows.

# 🔹 Block 451 — Timer ranges + pre-run load guards + overlap validity (22/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- TimerScreen contextual task ranges now include date when the range is not today (scheduled/projection formatting rule).
- Task List planning preview ranges now include date when not today.
- TimerScreen now suppresses stale running-overlap UI by validating decision still matches current schedule.
- TimerScreen no longer shows transient “Ready” during running idle gaps (syncing loader held when needed).
- PomodoroViewModel now allows loading **scheduled** groups even if another active session exists, so Pre-Run/overlap flows can open without bouncing back.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Scheduled-group loads are permitted under active-session conflict to unblock Pre-Run and overlap resolution; controls remain gated by conflict rules.
- Running-overlap validity is checked in TimerScreen to prevent persistent mirror conflict messaging after reschedule.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(not yet validated on devices)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate Pre-Run auto-open no longer bounces back to Groups Hub.
- Confirm “Ready” interstitial does not appear during ownership transitions.
- Re-test mirror conflict banners/snackbar suppression after overlaps resolve.

# 🔹 Block 452 — Late-start validation docs + countdown accuracy (23/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Specs updated: Pre-Run auto-open idempotency, late-start queue cancel behavior,
  anchored projections on resume, conflict modal context, status box ranges anchored
  to actualStartTime, and real-time countdown requirements for Task List/Groups Hub.
- Roadmap reopened items added for late-start cancel behavior, conflict modal context,
  pre-run auto-open idempotency, and real-time countdowns.
- AGENTS rule added: user-visible countdowns must update in real time (projection-only).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat all user-visible countdowns as projection-only but **always live-updated**.
- Clarify timebase responsibilities to avoid mixing scheduled/actual/anchor ranges.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement code fixes for late-start queue stability, pre-run auto-open navigation,
  countdown updates, conflict modal context, and run-mode range consistency.

# 🔹 Block 453 — Late-start queue fixes + live countdowns (23/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Task List pre-run banner now updates countdown every second via a local ticker.
- Late-start queue timebase now projects from `lateStartAnchorAt` on reopen
  (anchor-captured time fixed).
- Late-start queue Cancel clears queue metadata and navigates safely to Groups Hub.
- Late-start queue auto-exit now navigates to Groups Hub (no blank/black screen).
- Running conflict modal now includes the scheduled group's name and time range.
- Cancel-navigation retries no longer override a different timer route.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Pre-run countdowns are projection-only but must be live-updated while visible.
- Late-start queue cancel is treated as a cleanup action (clear queue fields).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(not yet validated on devices)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-validate late-start queue projections on macOS/Android after reopen.
- Verify pre-run auto-open is not overridden by Groups Hub navigation.
- Confirm conflict modal timing + context during running overlap scenarios.

# 🔹 Block 454 — Late-start anchor gating + Groups Hub live timing (23/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Late-start queue: navigation now requires a real anchor (no `DateTime.now()` fallback).
- Late-start queue cancel-all now exits to Groups Hub (no blank screen).
- Groups Hub adds a 1s ticker for live timing (effective schedule + pre-run state).
- Groups Hub hides Scheduled row for non-scheduled groups to avoid stale ranges.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- When the late-start anchor is missing, wait for it to materialize before opening the queue.
- Running/paused groups should not show scheduled-only rows.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(not yet validated on devices)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate queue open timing when the anchor is written on the owner device.
- Verify Groups Hub reflects postponed/anchored schedules in real time.

# 🔹 Block 455 — Late-start cancel-all + canceled reason labels (23/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Late-start queue Cancel now cancels all listed groups with confirmation and a
  re-plan note, then returns to Groups Hub.
- Continue with no selection now explains that canceled groups can be re-planned
  from Groups Hub.
- Groups Hub cards now show a canceled-reason label (Conflict / Missed schedule /
  Interrupted / Canceled).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Cancel in late-start queue resolves the conflict by canceling all groups to
  avoid re-open loops.
- Canceled reason labels are shown on the group card for clear context.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(not yet validated on devices)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate late-start Cancel all flow on macOS + Android.
- Verify canceled-reason labels in Groups Hub across canceled sources.

# 🔹 Block 456 — Canceled reason details + manual cancel doc (23/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Specs: explicit cancel-planning reason (user) added to Groups Hub actions.
- Specs: canceled reason label is now tappable with a details modal requirement.
- Groups Hub: reason row is tappable and opens a modal explaining the
  cancellation circumstance with a re-plan reminder.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- The reason modal uses a short, user-facing explanation per reason to avoid
  confusion and preserve trust.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(not yet validated on devices)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate the reason modal on macOS + Android (tap the reason label).

# 🔹 Block 457 — Validation plan + spec alignment (24/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a dedicated plan file for the validation fixes:
  `docs/bugs/plan_validacion_rapida_fix.md`.
- Specs updated to cover:
  - Pre-Run auto-open on owner + mirror and Run Mode auto-open at scheduled start.
  - Late-start queue mirror resolution (Owner resolved modal) and
    zero-selection = Cancel all behavior.
  - Groups Hub scheduled vs Pre-Run start labeling (“Pre-Run X min starts at …”).
  - Logout while running/paused must not produce a black screen.
  - Effective schedule must render live on mirrors during postpone.
  - Status boxes and contextual list ranges must remain consistent.
- Roadmap reopened items updated to track the new validation bugs explicitly.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Mirror devices must show an explicit “Owner resolved” modal before exiting a
  resolved late-start queue.
- Pre-Run and Run Mode auto-open must be idempotent on **all** signed-in devices.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Validation still reports: Pre-Run bounce/duplicate nav, Resolve overlaps
  without conflict, stale schedule on mirrors, +1 minute gaps, and logout
  black screen.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement the fixes in viewmodels/coordinators and UI per the updated specs.
- Re-run the checklist in `docs/bugs/validacion_rapida.md` on macOS + Android.

# 🔹 Block 458 — Validation fixes implementation (24/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Late-start queue: mirror “Owner resolved” modal + action lock when all groups
  are canceled; auto-claim suppressed once resolved.
- ScheduledGroupCoordinator: reset on app mode changes; late-start grace window
  added to avoid Pre-Run -> Running overlap queue races.
- Groups Hub: scheduled row now shows run start; Pre-Run row shows
  “Pre-Run X min starts at …” (cards + summary).
- TimerScreen: missing group now routes to Task List (Local Mode) or Groups Hub
  to avoid black screens.
- PomodoroViewModel: clear timeline phase anchor on resume to keep status boxes
  aligned with contextual ranges after pauses.
- Task List logout: clears pending auto-start state and resets coordinator.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Use a short grace window to prevent late-start queue from pre-empting the
  scheduled auto-start at the Pre-Run boundary.
- Favor navigation to Task List on Local Mode fallbacks to avoid empty routes.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(not yet validated on devices)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-run the validation checklist on macOS + Android.
- Verify Pre-Run auto-open idempotency, mirror cancel behavior, and logout flow.

# 🔹 Block 459 — Validation workflow + new validation folder (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- AGENTS.md updated to formalize the bug validation workflow and folder structure.
- Created `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_25/` with a new plan file.
- Initialized an empty `quick_pass_checklist.md` for the next validation cycle.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Validation folders are date-based; multiple validations in one day use a `-01`, `-02` suffix.
- Quick pass checklists are created only after implementation is complete.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement fixes listed in the 2026-02-25 plan before generating a new checklist.

# 🔹 Block 462 — Fix workflow enforcement (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- AGENTS.md updated to require plan updates, tests, and commit sequencing after each fix.
- Validation plan now includes a fix-tracking section for per-fix status updates.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Each fix must update the plan before moving to the next fix.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Begin fix #1 per the plan and update tracking after completion.

# 🔹 Block 463 — Fix 1: late-start owner resolved gating (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Late-start cancel-all now preserves the resolving owner ID to prevent owner-side "Owner resolved" modal.
- Mirror-only "Owner resolved" modal now dismisses via OK using the root navigator.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Preserve `lateStartOwnerDeviceId`/heartbeat on cancel-all so mirrors can show resolution while owners are exempt.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Proceed to Fix 2 (Android logout black screen).

# 🔹 Block 464 — Fix commit traceability rule (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- AGENTS.md updated to require recording commit hash + message in the plan after each fix.
- Fix 1 entry updated with commit metadata in the 2026-02-25 plan.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Commit metadata lives in the validation plan for per-fix traceability.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Continue with Fix 2 using the new commit-tracking rule.

# 🔹 Block 465 — Fix 2: Android logout black screen (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Reordered logout flow to navigate to Task List before signing out.
- Cleared scheduled/overlap state on logout to avoid stale navigation.
- Used root router for logout navigation to avoid context loss.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Logout now prioritizes stable navigation to `/tasks` before sign-out.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Proceed to Fix 3 (completion must navigate to Groups Hub).

# 🔹 Block 466 — Fix 3: completion navigation to Groups Hub (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a completion-dialog visibility guard to defer scheduled auto-open navigation.
- TimerScreen now tracks completion dialog visibility and no longer auto-dismisses due to scheduled open-timer actions.
- ScheduledGroupAutoStarter defers navigation actions while the completion dialog is visible.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Completion dialog now gates scheduled auto-open navigation to ensure Groups Hub is the post-completion landing.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Proceed to Fix 4 (false conflict at pre-run boundary).

# 🔹 Block 467 — Fix 4: pre-run boundary overlap grace (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated specs to treat pre-run overlap only after a 1-minute grace beyond pre-run start.
- Added a shared overlap-grace threshold helper for running overlap detection.
- Running overlap decisions now respect the grace window and recheck timing uses the same threshold.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Use a 1-minute grace window to avoid false conflict modals when the running end lands in the same minute as pre-run start.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Proceed to Fix 5 (task item time ranges vs status boxes).

# 🔹 Block 468 — Fix 5: status box ranges align with task ranges (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Status box ranges now anchor to the phase start timestamp instead of shifting with total pause offsets.
- Phase end now accounts for pauses after the phase starts, keeping end times accurate without moving starts.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Use phase-start time as the authoritative start for status boxes; only the end time absorbs pause offsets.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Proceed to Fix 6 (scheduled rows match on owner/mirror).

# 🔹 Block 469 — Fix 6: scheduled rows pre-run alignment (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Scheduled cards now derive Pre-Run rows from the effective pre-run start instead of raw notice minutes.
- Pre-Run visibility uses a shared effective pre-run helper, keeping owner/mirror rows consistent.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Pre-Run rows are shown only when an effective pre-run start exists (notice > 0).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Proceed to Fix 7 (re-plan "Start now" must always open Run Mode).

# 🔹 Block 470 — Fix 7: re-plan Start now opens Run Mode (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Groups Hub conflict cancellation now clears the active session when it references the canceled running group.
- Owner devices clear the session authoritatively to avoid the Start now flow being blocked by a stale activeSession.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- When canceling a running group from Groups Hub, clear the active session if it matches the canceled group to prevent blocked loadGroup navigation.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Update the 2026-02-25 validation checklist and run validation for Fix 1–7.

# 🔹 Block 471 — Feature backlog workflow prep (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added explicit In progress/Done workflow sections to `docs/feature_backlog.md`.
- Documented feature tracking rules in `AGENTS.md` to keep backlog items linked to feature folders and commits.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Backlog remains canonical; items move to In progress/Done instead of being deleted.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Use the new feature workflow when a backlog item moves to implementation.

# 🔹 Block 472 — Versioning bug/feature docs (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated `.gitignore` to version `docs/bugs` and `docs/features` while ignoring screenshots.
- Clarified in `AGENTS.md` that screenshots stay local but are not tracked in git.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep bug/feature docs in git for traceability; exclude screenshots to avoid repo bloat.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit the doc workflow updates and proceed with validation.

# 🔹 Block 473 — Fix 8: analyzer warnings cleanup (25/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Removed unnecessary non-null assertions in Groups Hub card pre-run calculations.
- Avoided using BuildContext across async gaps in Task List logout flow.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep pre-run calculations explicit to satisfy analyzer and avoid null assertions.
- Capture router before awaits and guard with `mounted` to avoid stale context.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Record the Fix 8 commit hash in the validation plan.

# 🔹 Block 474 — Fix 9 planning: Timer Run Mode bounce (26/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added Fix 9 scope to `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_25/plan_validacion_rapida_fix.md`.
- Updated `docs/specs.md` to document the short retry window when a just-created group is not found.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat "group not found" immediately after Start now / Run again / scheduled start as a transient read delay; retry briefly before navigating away.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Timer Run Mode can flash briefly then return to Groups Hub; user must tap "Open Run Mode" manually.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement Fix 9 (short retry on group load), run `flutter analyze`, and record commit hash in the plan.

# 🔹 Block 475 — Fix 9: retry group load before leaving Run Mode (26/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a short retry window when loading a just-created group in Run Mode.
- Cleared scheduled auto-start intent if the group truly does not exist after retries.
- Ran `flutter analyze` (no issues).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat immediate "group not found" after Start now / Run again / scheduled start as a transient read delay; retry briefly before navigating away.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Record the Fix 9 commit hash in the validation plan and prepare validation steps.

# 🔹 Block 476 — Fix 9 rework: unified Run Mode start pipeline (26/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated the Fix 9 plan to replace retry-based handling with a unified start pipeline.
- Updated `docs/specs.md` to require a single Run Mode start path with an in-memory snapshot.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Remove retry-based behavior in favor of a single authoritative start flow to avoid divergent entry paths.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Start now / Run again / scheduled auto-start can bounce back to Groups Hub due to inconsistent entry timing.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement the unified Run Mode start pipeline and remove the retry logic.

# 🔹 Block 477 — Fix 9: unified Run Mode start pipeline implemented (26/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Removed retry-based group load handling in Run Mode.
- Added a shared Run Mode launcher to prime the group snapshot and navigate via one entry path.
- Added an in-memory pending group override in the ViewModel to avoid immediate read races.
- Updated Start now / Run again / Open Run Mode / Pre-Run / auto-start to use the shared launcher.
- Adjusted scheduled auto-start navigation to avoid BuildContext async-gap warnings.
- Ran `flutter analyze` (no issues).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Use an in-memory snapshot to keep Run Mode entry deterministic across all entry points.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit Fix 9 and then record the commit hash in the validation plan.

# 🔹 Block 478 — Fix 10 diagnostics: scheduled auto-start bounce (26/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added targeted Run Mode diagnostic logs for scheduled auto-start flows.
- Instrumented auto-open, scheduled auto-start, and TimerScreen load outcomes to capture route + status.
- Updated validation plan to track the scheduled notice 0 bounce as Fix 10.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Use minimal structured logs (`[RunModeDiag]`) to pinpoint route churn without changing behavior.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Validation shows scheduled notice 0 still bounces to Groups Hub on Android and macOS.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-run the scheduled notice 0 validation with the new logs and confirm the exact exit path.

# 🔹 Block 479 — Fix 10: stabilize auto-open after scheduled start (26/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Adjusted auto-open to mark a group as opened only after confirming `/timer/:id`.
- Reset auto-open state when the route is not `/timer` to allow re-open after a bounce.
- Kept structured diagnostics (`[RunModeDiag]`) for validation.
- Ran `flutter analyze` (no issues).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Prevent suppression of auto-open unless the timer route is actually active.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-validate Run again (Android) and scheduled notice 0 with the new auto-open gating.

# 🔹 Block 480 — Fix 11: scheduled auto-start navigates before prefetch (26/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Moved scheduled auto-start navigation to `/timer/:id` before `getById` to remove the 1–2s Groups Hub delay.
- Kept prefetch/prime after navigation to preserve the in-memory snapshot when available.
- Ran `flutter analyze` (no issues).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Navigation must not be blocked by prefetch during scheduled auto-start.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-validate scheduled notice 0 on Android and macOS to confirm no Groups Hub flash.

# 🔹 Block 481 — Fix 12: ensure running groups auto-start on initial load (26/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a running-group auto-start check on initial TimerScreen load (covers Start now / Run again when the stream does not re-emit).
- Centralized running auto-start logic and reused it for stream updates.
- Marked scheduled auto-starts as handled to avoid duplicate start attempts.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- In Account Mode with a missing activeSession, only the initiating device (scheduledByDeviceId) is allowed to auto-start the running group.
- Avoid relying solely on stream emissions for Start now / Run again auto-start.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run `flutter analyze`.
- Validate Account Mode Start now / Run again creates `activeSession/current` and stays in Run Mode.

# 🔹 Block 482 — Fix 13: late-start queue claim resilience (26/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Hardened late-start queue claim parsing for mixed timestamp formats.
- Added claim failure handling so the queue can still be shown.
- Allowed late-start queue projection to fall back to heartbeat or local time when the anchor is missing.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- If anchor is missing but conflicts exist, prefer showing the queue (with a fallback timebase) rather than suppressing the flow.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run `flutter analyze`.
- Re-validate late-start queue cancel-all on macOS + Android.

# 🔹 Block 483 — Fix 14: re-evaluate late-start queue on mode switch (26/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Re-evaluated scheduled groups immediately after Local → Account mode switches.
- Removed the late-start queue grace delay so overdue overlaps are always evaluated.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Align the mode-switch behavior with the late-start queue trigger rules in `docs/specs.md`.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run `flutter analyze`.
- Validate late-start queue appears after switching Local → Account without restarting the app.

# 🔹 Block 484 — Temporary iOS debug prod override for simulator validation (27/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Documented a temporary iOS debug override in `docs/specs.md` to allow `APP_ENV=prod` with an explicit flag while staging is unavailable.
- Implemented `ALLOW_PROD_IN_DEBUG` (iOS debug only) to permit production Firebase use in debug builds for simulator validation.
- Updated `docs/bugs/README.md` with the iOS simulator debug command and override note.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- The override is opt-in, iOS-only, and must be removed once staging is configured.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-validate iOS simulator login with real accounts using `--debug` + `ALLOW_PROD_IN_DEBUG=true`.

# 🔹 Block 485 — Plan: auto-open trigger gating (27/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated `docs/specs.md` to define trigger-based auto-open rules and suppression while planning/editing/settings.
- Updated `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_25/plan_validacion_rapida_fix.md` to add Scope 16 and acceptance criteria for auto-open gating.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Auto-open is allowed only on explicit triggers (launch/resume, pre-run start, scheduled start, resolve overlaps, or user action).
- Leaving Run Mode suppresses auto-open until a new trigger occurs.
- Auto-open must never interrupt planning/editing/settings flows.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement auto-open gating in `lib/widgets/active_session_auto_opener.dart`.
- Run `flutter analyze`.
- Validate on iOS + Web + Android (no rebound while planning, auto-open still fires on triggers).

# 🔹 Block 486 — Fix 15: auto-open trigger gating (27/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated `ActiveSessionAutoOpener` to stop re-opening Run Mode on every session tick.
- Added route-sensitive suppression for planning/editing/settings/late-start flows.
- Allowed auto-open again on app resume (explicit trigger).
- Ran `flutter analyze` (no issues).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Leaving Run Mode while a session is active suppresses auto-open until a new trigger occurs.
- Auto-open is suppressed on sensitive routes and relies on explicit CTAs there.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate auto-open triggers (launch/resume, pre-run start, scheduled start) across iOS/Web/Android.
- Confirm no re-open while planning or editing.

# 🔹 Block 487 — Plan: iOS scheduled notice 0 black screen (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_25/plan_validacion_rapida_fix.md` to add Scope 17 and fix order for the iOS black screen issue.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Address the iOS black screen before Local Mode fixes to minimize regressions and keep changes localized.
- Treat the fix as a navigation stability issue: always land on Run Mode or a valid hub route after confirm.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Review iOS/Chrome logs for the black screen repro path.
- Implement the minimal navigation fallback to prevent black screens.
- Run `flutter analyze` and validate on iOS + Web.

# 🔹 Block 488 — Fix 16: avoid iOS black screen on scheduled notice 0 (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Guarded `TimerScreen` timers and async loads against dispose to prevent setState/ref usage after unmount.
- Moved completion-dialog visibility reset to `deactivate` and removed ref usage in `dispose`.
- Ran `flutter analyze` (no issues).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat the iOS black screen as a lifecycle/navigation safety issue (avoid async work on unmounted state).
- Prefer minimal guards and lifecycle-safe cleanup over navigation rewrites.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Reproduce scheduled notice 0 on iOS to confirm no black screen and no console exceptions.

# 🔹 Block 489 — Plan: Local Mode isolation + Run Mode stability (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated `docs/specs.md` to require clearing Run Mode and returning to Task List on mode switch.
- Updated `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_25/plan_validacion_rapida_fix.md` with Fix 17 scope, repro, and acceptance criteria.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Local Mode Start now must persist `actualStartTime` to enable correct projection and avoid Run Mode restarts.
- Scheduled auto-open must not navigate to `/timer/:id` in Local Mode if the group is missing.
- Mode switching should reset Run Mode state and land on Task List to prevent cross-mode UI/data bleed.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement Local Mode fixes (Start now `actualStartTime`, mode-switch guard, local auto-open gating).
- Run `flutter analyze`.
- Validate Local Mode repro steps and update checklist.

# 🔹 Block 490 — Fix 17: Local Mode isolation + Run Mode stability (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Set `actualStartTime` for Start now groups created from Task List to preserve Local Mode projections.
- Added `AppModeChangeGuard` to reset Run Mode state and return to Task List on mode switch.
- Guarded scheduled auto-open in Local Mode by skipping navigation when the group is missing.
- Ran `flutter analyze` (no issues).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Mode switches must hard-reset Run Mode to prevent cross-mode UI/data bleed.
- Local scheduled auto-open should be a no-op when the group is missing to avoid false snackbars.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate Local Mode repro steps and update the checklist.

# 🔹 Block 491 — Fix 17 validation results (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Ran Local Mode validation using the exact repro steps.
- Logged results in `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_25/quick_pass_checklist.md`.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Treat remaining Local Mode issues as follow-up fixes (Open Run Mode restarts group; Run Mode vs Groups Hub ranges mismatch).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Local Mode (Chrome): "Open Run Mode" restarts the running group each time.
- Local Mode (Chrome): Run Mode task ranges do not match Groups Hub "Ends" after the restart.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Fix Local Mode Run Mode restart on open (ensure re-open does not reset task start).
- Align Run Mode ranges with Groups Hub after re-open.

# 🔹 Block 492 — Plan: Local Mode Run Mode re-open stability (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_25/plan_validacion_rapida_fix.md` with Fix 18 scope, repro, and acceptance criteria.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- In Local Mode, re-opening a running group must never auto-start if `actualStartTime` already exists; use projection instead.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement the Local Mode auto-start guard in Run Mode.
- Run `flutter analyze`.
- Validate Fix 18 repro steps.

# 🔹 Block 493 — Fix 18: Local Mode Run Mode re-open stability (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Prevented Local Mode auto-start when a running group already has `actualStartTime` to avoid restart on re-open.
- Ran `flutter analyze` (no issues).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Local Mode re-open should always project from `actualStartTime` rather than re-creating the timer state.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate Fix 18 repro steps (Open Run Mode does not restart; ranges match).

# 🔹 Block 494 — Fix 18 validation results (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Validated Fix 18 with Local Mode re-open repro; Open Run Mode no longer restarts the group.
- Updated `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_25/quick_pass_checklist.md` with results.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Confirmed Local Mode re-open should always project from `actualStartTime`.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Continue with the next remaining validation items in the plan.

# 🔹 Block 495 — Regression smoke checks requirement (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a mandatory regression smoke check requirement to `AGENTS.md`.
- Added a fixed regression checklist to `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_25/plan_validacion_rapida_fix.md` and `quick_pass_checklist.md`.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Each fix must re-validate the most recent critical fixes to prevent silent regressions.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Apply the regression checklist after every subsequent fix in this validation track.

# 🔹 Block 496 — Regression checks validated (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Executed regression smoke checks after Fix 18.
- Logged results in `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_25/quick_pass_checklist.md`.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Regression checks are required for every fix and must be recorded.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(none)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Continue with the next fix in the plan.

# 🔹 Block 497 — Plan: Fix 19 status box ranges after pause (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_25/plan_validacion_rapida_fix.md` with Fix 19 scope and exact repro.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Preserve `phaseStartedAt` across pause/resume so status boxes keep the original phase start and extend the end by the pause duration.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement the pause/resume guard in `PomodoroViewModel.resume()`.
- Run `flutter analyze`.
- Validate Fix 19 repro steps and regression checks.

# 🔹 Block 498 — Fix 19: preserve phase start on resume (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Kept `phaseStartedAt` stable across pause/resume to avoid shifting status box ranges.
- Ran `flutter analyze` (no issues).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Pause/resume must extend phase end time without moving its original start.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate Fix 19 repro steps and regression checks.

# 🔹 Block 499 — Plan: Fix 20 mirror initial sync drift (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated `docs/specs.md` with a fallback offset rule when `lastUpdatedAt` is missing.
- Added Fix 20 scope + exact repro to `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_25/plan_validacion_rapida_fix.md`.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- When `lastUpdatedAt` is missing, derive an initial anchor using
  `phaseStartedAt + (phaseDurationSeconds - remainingSeconds)` to avoid a stale mirror start.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement fallback offset derivation in `PomodoroViewModel`.
- Run `flutter analyze`.
- Validate Fix 20 repro steps and regression checks.

# 🔹 Block 500 — Fix 20: mirror initial sync (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a fallback offset derivation when `lastUpdatedAt` is missing to avoid mirror drift.
- Ran `flutter analyze` (no issues).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Use `phaseStartedAt + (phaseDurationSeconds - remainingSeconds)` as the initial anchor when no offset exists.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(pending validation)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate Fix 20 repro steps and regression checks.

# 🔹 Block 501 — Fix 20 validation failed; plan Fix 21 (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Confirmed Fix 20 still fails when `lastUpdatedAt` is stale after mirror resume.
- Updated validation plan/checklist to track the failed Fix 20 and a new Fix 21.
- Updated specs/roadmap to include stale snapshot compensation for mirror projections.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Mirror devices must compensate stale `lastUpdatedAt` **only when running** by
  advancing the projection with the local delta, then re-anchor on the next snapshot.
- No compensation when paused or non-running to avoid time drift.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Mirror still starts behind after resume/Local→Account until the next heartbeat.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement Fix 21 in `PomodoroViewModel`.
- Run `flutter analyze`.
- Re-validate Fix 21 repro steps and regression checks.

# 🔹 Block 502 — Fix 21 attempt regressed; revise compensation strategy (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Captured Fix 21 validation failure (mirror countdown accelerates; >1s per tick).
- Updated checklist/plan with the regression details.
- Revised the approach: rebase the offset once instead of adding delta per tick.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Stale mirror compensation must **not** add a delta each tick.
- When the snapshot is stale and mirror is running, hold the existing offset
  (or set it to zero if missing) and wait for the next snapshot to re-anchor.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Attempted compensation caused mirror to tick ~2s per second until next snapshot.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Apply the revised offset-rebase logic.
- Run `flutter analyze`.
- Re-validate Fix 21 + regression checks.

# 🔹 Block 503 — Fix 21 attempt 2 failed; switch to fresh-snapshot gating (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Logged the new failure: owner/mirror desync persists after Local ↔ Account switches.
- Updated plan/checklist/specs to pivot to fresh-snapshot gating.
- Implemented fresh-snapshot gating in `PomodoroViewModel`.
- Ran `flutter analyze` (no issues).

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Stop using age-based compensation; instead gate projections on a **new**
  `lastUpdatedAt` after resume/mode switch.
- While waiting for a new snapshot, project from local time (no server offset).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Owner returned from Local with ~24s lag; drift persisted despite `lastUpdatedAt` updates.
- First cancel action forced a resync but did not cancel (second cancel required).

# 🔹 Block 504 — Fix 21 attempt 3 failed (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Logged the latest validation: iOS owner + Chrome mirror still desync after Local ↔ Account.
- Noted that Chrome logs remain incomplete post-launch.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Fresh-snapshot gating did not prevent desync on iOS owner resume.
- Chrome mirror still fails after Local → Account.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Revisit the sync/offset strategy with explicit server timestamp anchoring.

# 🔹 Block 505 — P0 plan: single source of truth for Run Mode (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Documented the P0 plan to enforce a single authoritative timeline for Run Mode.
- Updated specs/roadmap/validation plan to add time sync, sessionRevision, and paused offsets.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Account Mode projection must derive **only** from the authoritative timeline
  (`phaseStartedAt`, `phaseDurationSeconds`, `pausedAt`, `accumulatedPausedSeconds`)
  and a real server time offset (timeSync).
- `lastUpdatedAt` is liveness-only; it must not drive projection.
- Snapshots must be ordered by `sessionRevision` (ignore stale updates).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Existing offset-based approaches (lastUpdatedAt derived) continue to diverge.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Draft the implementation plan for Fix 22 (single source of truth).

# 🔹 Block 506 — Fix 22 implementation plan drafted (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added the Fix 22 implementation plan (time sync + sessionRevision + paused offsets) to the validation plan.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Review the Fix 22 plan and confirm before code changes.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-validate Fix 21 + regression checks.

# 🔹 Block 507 — Fix 22 implementation started (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Implemented TimeSyncService (server timestamp offset) + provider wiring.
- Added `sessionRevision` and `accumulatedPausedSeconds` to PomodoroSession.
- Updated Firestore rules for `users/{uid}/timeSync`.
- Refactored PomodoroViewModel projection to use server time + revision ordering
  (lastUpdatedAt is ordering-only).
- Updated scheduled auto-start + late-start queue initial session fields.
- Updated VM tests to include new session fields and disable time sync in tests.
- Ran `flutter test` (pause expiry, ownership request, session gap, scheduled coordinator) and `flutter analyze`.
- Commit: 5289922 "Fix 22: time sync single-source projection".

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Projections must derive only from `serverNow`, `phaseStartedAt`,
  `pausedAt`, and `accumulatedPausedSeconds`.
- Accept snapshots by `sessionRevision`; use `lastUpdatedAt` only as a
  secondary order tie-breaker.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None during implementation (validation still pending).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run `tools/check_release_safety.sh` (Firestore schema/rules touched).
- Complete validation scenarios for Fix 22 (owner/mirror, pause/resume,
  background, Local → Account).
- Commit Fix 22 after validation + plan updates.

# 🔹 Block 508 — Firestore rules deployed + TimerScreen spec alignment (28/02/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Deployed updated Firestore rules (timeSync path) to PROD project `focus-interval`.
- Updated `docs/specs.md` 10.4.8 to reference timeSync-based projection and Syncing session fallback.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Keep `lastUpdatedAt` as liveness only; TimerScreen spec now aligns with timeSync.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate Fix 22 scenarios (owner/mirror, pause/resume, background, Local → Account).

# 🔹 Block 509 — Fix 22 P0-1: stale snapshot guard (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Prevented stale activeSession snapshots from updating session counters when the
  timeline should not be applied (ignore outdated revision updates).
- Logged Fix 22 P0-1 in the validation plan.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not run (Flutter test requires sandbox approval).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None during implementation (validation pending).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement P0-2: timeSync gating + intent queue + non-blocking syncing overlay.

# 🔹 Block 510 — Fix 22 P0-2: timeSync gating + intent queue (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added timeSync gating for Start/Resume/Auto-start in Account Mode with a
  pending intent queue.
- Added a non-blocking Syncing overlay (timer stays visible) and retry state
  when time sync stalls.
- Auto-start now waits for server time; no local fallback when time sync is
  unavailable.

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/pomodoro_view_model_session_gap_test.dart test/presentation/viewmodels/scheduled_group_coordinator_test.dart` (passed)

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None during implementation (validation pending).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement P0-3: render Run Mode from activeSession projection for owner and mirror.

# 🔹 Block 511 — Fix 22 P0-2b: block publish without timeSync (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Blocked session publish (including heartbeats) in Account Mode when timeSync is
  unavailable; trigger refresh and mark syncing instead of writing local time.
- Overlay now appears **only** when a snapshot exists; otherwise a full loader is
  shown even if there is a pending intent.

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/pomodoro_view_model_session_gap_test.dart test/presentation/viewmodels/scheduled_group_coordinator_test.dart` (passed)

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None during implementation (validation pending).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement P0-3: render Run Mode from activeSession projection for owner and mirror.

# 🔹 Block 512 — Fix 22 P0-2b: add guardrail tests (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added widget test to enforce UI rule: pending intent + no snapshot shows full
  loader (no timer visible).
- Added VM test to ensure Account Mode with missing timeSync does not publish
  activeSession and forces a refresh.

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/pomodoro_view_model_session_gap_test.dart test/presentation/timer_screen_syncing_overlay_test.dart` (passed)

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement P0-3: render Run Mode from activeSession projection for owner and mirror.

# 🔹 Block 513 — Spec clarification: no writes without timeSync (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Clarified in specs that, in Account Mode, **no** authoritative writes are
  allowed when server-time offset is unavailable (includes start/resume/auto-start,
  heartbeats, and republish/recovery writes).
- Clarified that heartbeat requirements apply only when time sync is ready.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not applicable (documentation update).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Implement P0-3: render Run Mode from activeSession projection for owner and mirror.

# 🔹 Block 514 — Fix 22 P0-3: render from activeSession (owner + mirror) (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- In Account Mode, ignored PomodoroMachine stream updates when an activeSession
  is present, missing, or awaiting confirmation (preventing local render drift).
- Unified owner + mirror rendering from activeSession projection with a shared
  projection timer (no machine-driven UI in Account Mode).
- Added “awaiting session confirmation” gating after owner start/pause/resume
  (syncing hold until snapshot arrives; controls disabled).
- TimerScreen now treats “awaiting session confirmation” as syncing (overlay
  only when a snapshot exists).
- Added regression test to ensure machine stream does not override state when
  an activeSession is present.

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/pomodoro_view_model_session_gap_test.dart test/presentation/timer_screen_syncing_overlay_test.dart` (passed)

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None during implementation (validation pending).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- P0-3 validation (multi-device scenarios).
- Continue with P0-4: monotonic guard in repo/rules + write ordering.

# 🔹 Block 515 — Fix 22 P0-4: monotonic guard + write serialization (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added monotonic sessionRevision guard in Firestore session repository
  (incoming < current ignored; equal treated as idempotent heartbeat).
- Added session write serialization in VM; queued publishes drop obsolete
  writes by revision/context/ownership before sending.
- Added Firestore rules enforcing monotonic sessionRevision (legacy allowed only
  when the stored document lacks the field).
- Added unit tests for the session write decision logic.

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/pomodoro_view_model_session_gap_test.dart test/presentation/timer_screen_syncing_overlay_test.dart test/data/repositories/firestore_pomodoro_session_repository_test.dart` (passed)

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None during implementation (validation pending).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- P0-4 validation (multi-device).
- Continue with P0-5: discard obsolete queued writes on session/context changes.

# 🔹 Block 516 — Firestore rules deployed (prod) (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Deployed `firestore.rules` to production via `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not applicable.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- CLI warning: `firebase.json` contains unknown property `flutter` (non-blocking).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate P0-4 on prod rules.

# \ud83d\udd39 Block 517 — Roll back activeSession rules to pre-P0-4 (01/03/2026)

### \u2714 Work completed:

- Reverted `activeSession` Firestore rules to pre-P0-4 permissive version
  (same as commit `2c788c3`) after permission-denied errors in validation.
- Redeployed rules to prod (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`).

### \ud83e\uddea Tests:

- Not applicable.

### \u26a0\ufe0f Issues found:

- Validation logs showed `[cloud_firestore/permission-denied]` on auto-start
  (`2026_03_01_ios_simulator_iphone_17_pro_diag.log`).

### \ud83c\udfaf Next steps:

- Re-run P0-4 validation after rules rollback.
- Design a backward-compatible monotonic rules variant before reintroducing it.

# 🔹 Block 518 — Fix 22g: auto-open bounce guard + pause persistence + safe nav (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a short auto-open bounce window to re-open TimerScreen only when a
  session falls back to `/groups` shortly after auto-open, without re-enabling
  intrusive auto-open on sensitive routes.
- Made TimerScreen navigation to Groups Hub post-frame to avoid
  `setState/markNeedsBuild during build` Router errors.
- Resume now falls back to `session.pausedAt` when local `_pauseStartedAt`
  is missing, and awaits pause offset persistence to prevent early end.
- Group timeline projection no longer shifts task start by pause offset.
- Enriched activeSession debug snapshot log with pause fields.

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/pomodoro_view_model_session_gap_test.dart test/presentation/timer_screen_syncing_overlay_test.dart` (passed)

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Validation pending (P0-4 regressions: bounce to Groups Hub, pause not applied,
  status box start shift, iOS setState during build).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run targeted tests (timer screen + viewmodel) and revalidate multi-device.

# 🔹 Block 519 — Fix 22g validation failed (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Validation run started for Fix 22g using Android + iOS logs.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not applicable.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Scheduled auto-start (notice 0) fails: iOS stuck on “Syncing session…” with black background; Run Mode never opens.
- Firestore `activeSession/current` ends in `status=finished` with `remainingSeconds=0` and `phaseStartedAt=null`.
- Remaining checklist steps could not be validated due to the block.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Investigate why scheduled auto-start produces a finished activeSession.
- Validate auto-start path against timeSync/sessionRevision gating.

# 🔹 Block 520 — Fix 22h: clear inactive activeSession in VM + repo (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Treat non-active activeSession snapshots (finished/canceled/idle) as null in
  PomodoroViewModel; avoid storing them as `_latestSession`.
- Added Firestore repository cleanup: `clearSessionIfInactive` deletes the doc
  only when server status is not active (transactional guard).
- Completion/cancel now clear activeSession regardless of control gating and
  also trigger inactive cleanup for the current group.
- Updated PomodoroSessionRepository fakes in tests to match the new interface.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not run (pending validation).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Validation pending.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-run the validation checklist (owner/mirror + auto-start).
- If passed, record commit hash and update plan/checklist.

# 🔹 Block 521 — Fix 22h validation (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Validation run on Android + iOS with logs:
  `2026_03_01_android_RMX3771_diag-0.log`,
  `2026_03_01_ios_simulator_iphone_17_pro_diag-0.log`.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not applicable.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- A `current` session reappears on app open and starts running without user action; it finishes unexpectedly and does not appear in Groups Hub.
- Pre-run does not auto-open; stays in Groups Hub with banner until user taps “Open Pre-Run”.
- Owner stays in “Syncing session…” after auto-start for minutes; only resolves after navigating away (Groups Hub) and returning.
- Auto-start succeeds on second attempt; cancel clears `activeSession/current`; mirror sync is OK.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Investigate phantom auto-start on app open (stale group rehydration vs auto-start trigger).
- Fix pre-run auto-open behavior and eliminate long “Syncing session…” holds for owner.

# 🔹 Block 522 — Fix 22i: auto-start throttle + missing-session recovery + nav retry (01/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added auto-start throttling in PomodoroViewModel to prevent duplicate
  `startFromAutoStart` calls for the same group in a short window.
- When activeSession goes missing, keep a projected state from the last known
  session and force a server resync to reduce prolonged “Syncing session…”.
- Scheduled auto-start navigation now verifies route change and retries if the
  app fails to land on `/timer/:groupId`.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not run.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None during validation.

### ✅ Validation (Fix 22i)

- Logs: `2026_03_01_android_RMX3771_diag-1.log`,
  `2026_03_01_ios_simulator_iphone_17_pro_diag-1.log`.
- Auto-start duplicate (phantom running): OK.
- Pre-run auto-open: OK.
- Auto-start to Run Mode: OK (no bounce to Groups Hub).
- Syncing session: only brief flicker, no prolonged hold.
- Cancel cleanup: OK (current cleared).
- Mirror: OK (no permanent syncing on open).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Commit: fb582f6 "Fix 22i: auto-start throttle + missing-session recovery".

# 🔹 Block 523 — Allow prod debug override on all platforms (02/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated specs to allow a temporary `ALLOW_PROD_IN_DEBUG=true` override for
  `APP_ENV=prod` in debug on all platforms (temporary until staging exists).
- Removed platform restriction in `AppConfig` so the override works on web,
  macOS, and other targets in debug.
- Updated bug validation docs and added a new validation folder for this fix.
- Cleaned a test analyzer lint (prefer_final_fields).

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter analyze` (passed).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Validate debug + prod boot on Chrome and macOS with
  `ALLOW_PROD_IN_DEBUG=true`.
- Revert the override once staging is configured and in use.

# 🔹 Block 524 — Update bug log commands for debug prod override (02/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Expanded `docs/bugs/README.md` with debug + prod commands (override) for all
  supported platforms, keeping release commands available.
- Added explicit "temporal" labeling for the override in the command sections.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not applicable (docs-only change).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Use the debug + prod commands with `ALLOW_PROD_IN_DEBUG=true` until staging exists.
- Revert the override commands once staging is configured.

# 🔹 Block 525 — Fix TimeSync deadlock + auth gating (02/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Updated specs to allow fallback heartbeats/publishes when time sync is missing,
  while still blocking start/resume/auto-start without server offset.
- Fixed provider gating so TimeSync and activeSession repositories stay enabled
  when `currentUser` exists (avoid transient auth nulls downgrading to Noop).
- Allowed `_publishCurrentSession()` to publish with local-time fallback while
  time sync is unavailable (prevents `activeSession` from freezing).
- Created validation folder `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_03_02-02/` with plan.

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter analyze` (passed).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None yet (validation pending).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run rapid validation on Chrome/macOS debug + prod override.
- Record commit hash in the validation plan and complete checklist.

# 🔹 Block 526 — Allow owner heartbeats while awaiting/missing (02/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Allowed session publish to proceed while missing session when this device is
  the owner and execution is active (prevents `lastUpdatedAt` freeze).
- Allowed heartbeats to publish while awaiting session confirmation to avoid
  deadlocks during initial ownership.
- Updated validation plan for the TimeSync deadlock fix.

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter analyze` (passed).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None yet (validation pending).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-run rapid validation in Chrome/macOS and confirm `lastUpdatedAt` advances.
- Update the checklist and plan tracking with the new commit hash.

# 🔹 Block 527 — Validate TimeSync deadlock fix (02/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Completed rapid validation for the TimeSync deadlock fix on Chrome (web) and macOS.
- Confirmed `users/{uid}/timeSync/anchor` creation and advancing
  `activeSession/current.lastUpdatedAt`.
- Updated the validation plan and checklist for
  `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_03_02-02/`.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Manual validation (Chrome debug + prod override, macOS debug + prod override).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- None.

# 🔹 Block 528 — Owner local stream + no remote projection (02/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Owner no longer ignores the local PomodoroMachine stream in Account Mode.
- Removed mirror projection for owner sessions (no `_setMirrorSession` in owner paths).
- Owner hydration now allows local-time fallback when server offset is missing.
- Created validation folder `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_03_02-03/` with plan + empty checklist.

### 🧠 Decisions made:

- Owner must always render from the local machine; mirrors project from session snapshots.
- If time sync is missing, owner uses local time for projection to avoid frozen UI.

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter analyze` (passed).
- `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/pomodoro_view_model_session_gap_test.dart` (passed).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

_(not yet validated on devices)_

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run rapid validation (Android owner + macOS mirror) and update checklist.
- Record commit hash in the validation plan.

# 🔹 Block 529 — Plan Group pre-run notice control (02/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a "Pre-run notice" row to Plan group with a realtime-valid range.
- Planning now carries the notice value and persists it on new TaskRunGroups.
- Re-plan snackbar offers Change notice and reopens planning with a valid suggestion.
- Task List and Groups Hub creation flows use the selected notice consistently.

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter analyze` (passed).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Complete feature checklist validation and record results.

# 🔹 Block 530 — ActiveSession payload persistence + owner sync guards (02/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Fixed Firestore activeSession idempotent writes to persist full payload when
  `sessionRevision` is unchanged but session fields changed (`remainingSeconds`,
  phase/status fields, timeline fields).
- Stabilized owner sync flow in `PomodoroViewModel`:
  - removed owner mirror-projection path,
  - allowed projection local fallback when server offset is temporarily missing,
  - added `ref.mounted` lifecycle guards on async resync/snapshot paths.
- Updated session gap test expectations to match the current publish policy when
  time sync is unavailable.

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/pomodoro_view_model_session_gap_test.dart` (passed).
- `flutter test test/presentation/viewmodels/pomodoro_view_model_pause_expiry_test.dart` (passed).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Device validation for the long-run (20–30 min) Android syncing scenario is still pending.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run long-run validation with a fresh running group (no carry-over from previous builds).
- Record final validation evidence in `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_03_02-03/`.

# 🔹 Block 531 — IDEA-032 validated + auto-clamp SnackBar UX fix (02/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Validated IDEA-032 (Plan Group Pre-Run Notice Control) on Android RMX3771,
  debug prod, 02/03/2026.
- All 8 checklist items passed. See
  `docs/features/feature_2026_03_02_plan-group-notice-control/feature_checklist.md`.
- Minor UX improvement added during validation:
  - The 1s ticker in `task_group_planning_screen.dart` now emits a SnackBar
    ("Pre-run notice reduced to Xm — maximum allowed before the scheduled
    start.") whenever it auto-clamps `_noticeMinutes` to the realtime max.
  - Covers Check 4 (notice invalid while screen open) and Check 8 (user picks
    a start time with insufficient margin). Both confirmed working in real time.
- `flutter analyze` — 0 issues.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Manual validation on device (Android RMX3771), 02/03/2026.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Address pending long-run Android sync validation from Block 530.

# 🔹 Block 532 — Sync freeze fix validation closed (Android isolated) (02/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Closed validation for Block 530 using Android execution evidence.
- Confirmed no permanent "Syncing session..." hold and no freeze while changing
  timer/phase during the observed run.
- Updated roadmap and validation artifacts to mark this fix as validated.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Manual validation on Android RMX3771 (Account Mode, isolated run).
- Evidence log:
  `docs/features/feature_2026_03_02_plan-group-notice-control/logs/2026_03_02_android_RMX3771_feature.log`.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None in this run.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Keep monitoring; if regression reappears (especially multi-device), reopen the
  Phase 13 item and attach fresh validation logs.

# 🔹 Block 533 — Account pre-run notification cancellation + late-start recheck instrumentation (03/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Documented Account → Local notification cancellation rule in `docs/specs.md`.
- Updated validation plan and checklist for `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_24/`.
- Implemented Account → Local pre-run notification cancellation in `AppModeController`.
- Added debug instrumentation and account-mode recheck trigger in `ScheduledGroupCoordinator`.
- Updated roadmap entry for the fix (validation pending).

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not run (manual validation pending).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Validation pending for late-start queue after Local → Account and Local Mode notification suppression.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run the one-pass checklist in `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_24/quick_pass_checklist.md` and capture logs/screenshots.

# 🔹 Block 534 — Late-start retry instrumentation + cancel fix moved to coordinator (03/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Moved Account → Local pre-run notification cancellation into `ScheduledGroupCoordinator`
  to avoid provider circular dependency.
- Added debug logs for scheduled/pre-alert timers and auto-start retry timers.
- Updated validation plan to reflect the implementation shift.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not run (manual validation pending).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Late-start queue still not triggering in the latest attempt; logs showed no
  evaluation near the scheduled start and the pre-run cancellation path hit a
  circular dependency (now fixed).

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-run the late-start checklist path and capture fresh logs to confirm timer
  scheduling and overdue detection behavior.

# 🔹 Block 535 — Timer cancellation diagnostics for late-start regression (03/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added debug logs to trace timer cancellation and provider invalidation during
  mode changes and scheduled group evaluation.
- Updated validation plan with the new diagnostic instrumentation.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not run (manual validation pending).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Late-start queue still not triggering; investigation now focused on timer
  cancellation or coordinator disposal.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-run the late-start scenario and capture logs with the new
  `timer-state` and `AppModeGuard` markers.

# 🔹 Block 536 — Account recheck burst + late-start heartbeat transaction fix (03/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Added a bounded account-mode recheck burst after Local → Account mode switches
  to re-evaluate scheduled groups and recover timers after provider disposal.
- Fixed Firestore late-start heartbeat updates to read all docs before writes,
  preventing transaction ordering crashes.
- Updated specs and bug validation plan with the new behavior and root-cause notes.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not run (manual validation pending).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Validation pending for late-start queue and scheduled auto-start after mode switch.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Run `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_24/quick_pass_checklist.md` and capture
  fresh logs/screenshots.

# 🔹 Block 537 — Preserve coordinator on logout (03/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Removed logout invalidation of `scheduledGroupCoordinatorProvider` so the
  coordinator is not disposed mid-schedule; mode changes now rely on the
  coordinator reset hook to clear timers safely.
- Updated the validation plan and roadmap entries accordingly.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not run (manual validation pending).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Validation pending for late-start queue and scheduled auto-start after mode switch.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-run the Local → Account late-start scenario with fresh logs to confirm
  timers survive and the queue appears.

# 🔹 Block 538 — Mirror late-start queue resolves after owner action (03/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Mirror now treats a resolved late-start queue (anchor/owner cleared) as
  "Owner resolved" and exits to Groups Hub.
- Suppressed mirror auto-claim once the queue is already resolved so actions
  remain read-only until ownership is explicitly requested or stale.

### 🧪 Tests:

- Not run (manual validation pending).

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Validation pending for mirror ownership behavior in late-start resolution.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Re-run the late-start queue on owner + mirror and confirm mirror is blocked
  after owner resolves the queue.

# 🔹 Block 539 — Urgent pending: single source of truth breach (03/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Documented the urgent pending items and next steps in
  `docs/bugs/validation_fix_2026_02_24/plan_validacion_rapida_fix.md` to prevent
  partial implementations from being lost.

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- Run Mode in Account Mode can apply two timelines: `PomodoroSession` projection
  plus `TaskRunGroup` projection, which ignores `accumulatedPausedSeconds` and
  causes timer drift after pause (observed when returning from Groups Hub).
- P0-4 validation failed and rules were rolled back; P0-5 remains unimplemented.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Update `docs/specs.md` to make `PomodoroSession` the sole timeline in Account
  Mode when a session exists (group timeline projection only in Local Mode).
- Fix `PomodoroViewModel._hydrateOwnerSession` to skip
  `_applyGroupTimelineProjection` in Account Mode.
- Re-run Step 6 (pause → Groups Hub → return) and confirm owner/mirror drift
  stays within tolerance.
- Record final commit hash + validation results in plan/roadmap/dev log.

# 🔹 Block 540 — Remove unused Task List import (03/03/2026)

### ✔ Work completed:

- Removed an unused `scheduled_group_coordinator.dart` import from
  `TaskListScreen`.

### 🧪 Tests:

- `flutter analyze`

### ⚠️ Issues found:

- None.

### 🎯 Next steps:

- Continue with the pending validation workstreams in the current plan.
