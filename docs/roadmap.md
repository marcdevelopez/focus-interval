- Handle conflicts: if an active session exists, allow “Take over” (overwrite `ownerDeviceId`) or respect the remote session.
- Clear `activeSession` on finish or cancel.
- On app launch/login, auto-open TimerScreen if an active session is running.
- If auto-open cannot occur, a fallback entry point must exist (implemented in Phase 19).

---

# 🚀 **PHASE 18 — Run Mode Redesign for TaskRunGroups (In progress)**

### ⚙️ Tasks

- Prerequisite: complete Phases 15–17 (TaskRunGroup + PomodoroSession group context)
  before starting the TimerScreen redesign.
- ✅ Implemented and locked (do not change without explicit approval):
  - Run Mode layout: current time inside circle, status boxes (current/next), contextual list.
  - Status boxes and contextual list show time ranges (HH:mm–HH:mm).
  - "Next" box is golden-green only at the last pomodoro of the last task (end of group).
  - During a break, if this is the last break of a task and more tasks remain, "Next" shows End of task (no next-task details).
  - Auto-transitions between tasks are handled in PomodoroViewModel (no modal; UI only renders state).
  - TimerDisplay visual is ring + shadowed marker dot (no needle/hand); keep base ring/shadows and red/blue/amber ring colors.
  - Groups Hub indicator exists in the Run Mode header (placeholder until Phase 19).
  - On resume/pause, projected time ranges are recalculated for status boxes and contextual list.
- 🔜 Remaining (Phase 18 scope):
  - Group completion UX must end in the correct final state and navigation:
    completion modal + final center state + navigate to Groups Hub after dismiss.
  - Keep the completion summary (total tasks, pomodoros, total time) and wire it to the final flow; do not remove it.

### 📌 Exit conditions

- Full group execution works end-to-end with correct UI and transitions.
- Completion modal includes the optional summary data.
- Header shows a visual indicator when pending groups exist (Groups Hub).
- Status boxes and contextual task list show time ranges.
- TimerDisplay visual remains the approved ring + marker (no needle/hand).

# 🚀 **PHASE 19 — Groups Hub Screen**

### ⚙️ Tasks

- Create Groups Hub screen accessible from Run Mode header.
- List scheduled/running/last N completed groups with required fields.
- Actions: view summary, cancel schedule, start now (if no conflict).
- Add running-group entry points (Task List banner + Groups Hub "Open Run Mode" action).
- Add "Run again" for completed groups to duplicate the snapshot into a new TaskRunGroup and open planning.
- Provide direct navigation to the Task List screen (Task Library).
- Auto-navigate to Groups Hub after group completion (only after the user dismisses the completion modal).

### 📌 Exit conditions

- Groups Hub screen manages group lifecycle reliably and serves as the post-completion landing view.

# 🚀 **PHASE 20 — Responsive Updates for New Run Mode**

### ⚙️ Tasks

- Implement a dynamically calculated minimum size.
- Proportional clock scaling.
- Re-layout buttons to keep the circle unobstructed.
- Mobile landscape layout: move status boxes and contextual list to the right.
- Ensure desktop resizing still keeps the circle and text readable.
- Validate minimum size constraints with the new layout.
- Dark theme background must be pure black (#000000); light theme uses a light background with strong contrast.
- Enforce fixed-width timer digits (FontFeature.tabularFigures() or monospaced font) to avoid jitter.
- Set the initial window size to the computed minimum optimal size on app launch.

### 📌 Exit conditions

- Run Mode remains legible and stable across mobile landscape and desktop resizing.
- App usable at 1/4 of the screen.
